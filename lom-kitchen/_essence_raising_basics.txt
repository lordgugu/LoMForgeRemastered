1. Coins Only
  At first the only things which clearly helped raise essences were silver and
gold coins. This could raise essences up to 4 but sometimes only 3. In order
to raise an essence, energy and a taint point (TP) are needed. With enough
energy an essence can be raised for each TP. How much energy is needed can be
determined by the essences resistance. Now, we can look up the resistance in a
table, but in the old days it was all trial and error. Whether something was
called high or low resist was based only on if a method worked or not. Here is
a partial energy chart. I've cut things off at 64, because thats how much
energy is available from a gold coin.

 1  2  3  4
10 20 40  -
 9 18 36  -
 8 16 32 64
 7 14 28 56
 6 12 24 48

So, if the material had a resistance of 9 or 10 it could only get to essence
level 3, but if it was a lower resist it could get to 4.

Now for the recipe. Lets assume a resistance of 8.

dryad silver [1]    (dryad)/    --/    --/ --
dryad silver [2,3]  (dryad)/ dryad/    --/ --
dryad gold   [4]    (dryad)/ dryad/ dryad/ --

When the first silver coin is added is gives 48 energy and a dryad TP. Since
only 8 energy is needed there is plenty to get from 0 to 1. When the second
silver coin is added a dryad card is pushed on. This provides an additional TP
so with enough energy dryad could go up two. To go from 1 to 3 we need 16 + 32
energy, and thats exactly how much we have. When the gold coin is added
another dryad card is pushed on, so three TP are available, but the 64 energy
is only enough to raise dryad by one.

An interesting thing would have happened if we had done this with wisp. Some
cards need energy to be produced. All essence cards are like this, but wisp
and shade are the only essences which can take energy before card checks. The
effect of this is seen when the wisp gold doesn't produce a card. The gold
coin has 64 energy and it takes 64 energy to raise wisp to 4. There is zero
energy when the card check is made so the card isn't produced.

wisp silver [1]    (wisp)/   --/ --/ --
wisp silver [2,3]  (wisp)/ wisp/ --/ --
wisp gold   [4]    (wisp)/ wisp/ --/ --


2. +Chaos Crystals
  If you started tempering the essences in order (wisp, shade, dryad, aura,
sala, gnome, jinn, undine) you would find that shade, aura, gnome, and undine
wouldn't rise. These essences are said to be in conflict. But its not quite
that bad. As long as wisp and shade are equal, aura and dryad won't be in
conflict. And as long as you raise shade before wisp there won't be a conflict
there. Just don't raise wisp above shade or shade will drop to 0! So gnome
and undine are the only two that are stuck in conflict. A chaos crystal can
be used to produce an ancient moon card which allows conflicting essences to
raise. That makes for a simple fix to the original formula.

chaos crystal      (   AM)/    --/    --/ --
gnome silver [1]   (gnome)/    AM/    --/ --
gnome silver [2,3] (gnome)/ gnome/    AM/ --
gnome gold   [4]   (gnome)/ gnome/ gnome/ AM

But its not quite that simple. Ancient Moon is a "world" card, and these cards
have some interesting properties. One is that they are in effect when they are
visible, even the turn that they leave. Another is that they don't like to
coexist. If you had added a chaos crystal after the gnome gold it wouldn't
produce an ancient moon card. In general you need 4 cards between world cards
in order for them both to appear.


3. +Glow Crystals
  Glow crystals are the most energetic card in the game at 96 energy. AND they
produce the nymph of dawn card which gives up 196 energy when it comes off the
item. So together that gets our max energy from 64 to 288.

 1  2  3  4   5   6
10 20 40 80 160   -
 9 18 36 72 144 288
 8 16 32 64 128 256
 7 14 28 56 112 224
 6 12 24 48  96 192

Here is a recipe.

glow crystal       (  NoD)/    --/    --/    --
glow crystal       (  NoD)/   NoD/    --/    --
dryad silver [1]   (dryad)/   NoD/   NoD/    --
dryad silver [2,3] (dryad)/ dryad/   NoD/   NoD
glow crystal [4,5] (  NoD)/ dryad/ dryad/   NoD (NoD leaving)
glow crystal [6]   (  NoD)/   NoD/ dryad/ dryad (NoD leaving)

If dryad is resist 9 then the second dryad silver won't have enough energy to
raise the 2 and 3. There are two ways to deal with that. Either use a dryad
gold or use another glow crystal at the beginning.

Recipe in conflict.

chaos crystal     (    AM)/     --/     --/     --
undine silver [1] (undine)/     AM/     --/     --
glow crystal  [2] (   NoD)/ undine/     AM/     --
glow crystal  [3] (   NoD)/    NoD/ undine/     AM
glow crystal  [4] (   NoD)/    NoD/    NoD/ undine (AM leaving)
chaos crystal     (    AM)/    NoD/    NoD/     -- (NoD leaving) ***
undine silver     (undine)/     AM/    NoD/    NoD
glow crystal  [5] (   NoD)/ undine/     AM/    NoD (NoD leaving)
glow crystal  [6] (   NoD)/    NoD/ undine/     AM (NoD leaving)

A nymph of dawn left when the chaos crystal was added. That is because chaos
crystals only have 24 energy. When a NoD sees 24 or less energy she
contributes her energy and leaves. This means only one NoD will leave a turn
except in some strange wisp/shade setups.


4. +Mercury/Sulpher
  Sulpher produces the sorcerer card which reduces resistance on wisp, dryad,
sala, and gnome. Mercury produces the witch card which reduces resistance on
shade, aura, jinn, and gnome. The amount of the reduction is only suppose to
be 75%, but the coders did something funky with integer math. Usually one
would multiply by 3 then divide by 4, but our coders divided by 4 then
multiplied by 3. Here is a chart of the difference. There is a minimum
resistance of 1.

start [*3 /4] [/4 *3] [*3/4]^2 [/4*3]^2 [*3/4]^3 [/4*3]^3
11    8       6       6        3        4        1
10    7       6       5        3        3        1
9     6       6       4        3        3        1
8     6       6       4        3        3        1
7     5       3       3        1        2        1
6     4       3       3        1        2        1
5     3       3       2        1        1        1
4     3       3       2        1        1        1
3     2       1       1        1        1        1
2     1       1       1        1        1        1
1     1       1       1        1        1        1

This gives the modern definition of high and low resist.

      1card 2cards 3cards
high
8-11      6      3      1

low
5-7       3      1      1


 1  2  3  4   5   6   7   8   9
11 22 44 88 176   -   -   -   -
10 20 40 80 160   -   -   -   -
 9 18 36 72 144 288   -   -   -
 8 16 32 64 128 256   -   -   -
 7 14 28 56 112 224   -   -   -
_6_12_24_48__96_192___-___-___-

_3__6_12_24__48__96_192___-___-
_1__2__4__8__16__32__64_128_256

So through careful use of coins, glow crystals and mercury/sulpher we can get
up to 9s. One thing which complicates matters is that mercury and sulpher only
have 24 energy. Wisp and shade can only benefit from wizard cards if they are
cards and the wizard cards occur before them (lower on the list).
