Now, this is for discussion of Tempering.

Also, me and shiyala will be gone for a few days. We're off to a Drama Festival to perform. It's very scary.

Meanwhile, post/answer questions here, and when I get back, if anything is unanswered, I'll answer it ^__^

Ok, I'll start
1. What are the conditions for getting fertility goddess to work on an item?
2. What effects the stat maximums on equipment.
3. What could cause an item to go from +20s to +15s?
4. Can you get +20 stats on a wood item? 
From: MarcusMajarra | Posted: 3/5/2003 9:26:56 PM | Message Detail 
1) Dryad at least 3, total of essence levels at least 5.
2) Every item with limitations. The biggest range available is selected by default, with 0 -> +1 when no other ranges are available.
3) Any stat reduction that occurs after the stats are at +20. The sequence for bonus attribution seems to be: innate, top card, middle card, bottom card.
4) You can get +20 on any material. Limitations have nothing to do with materials.

1. What are the conditions for getting fertility goddess to work on an item?
Fertility Goddess "works" on all items, but adds the Share-Experience Effect only on a Ring.

2. What effects the stat maximums on equipment.
The Mystic Cards and the item tempered in. For example, Bellgrapes will allow Magic to go up to +10, and they give +1 Magic each time you add one. So, if you just add Bellgrapes, your Magic will be +10. Then, when you add a different item (unless you have a Card with limitations of up to +10 magic), the Magic will fall down back to the limitations.

3. What could cause an item to go from +20s to +15s?
Either:
(a) The Limitations are no longer there (example: Evil God Card leaves, leaving only a Card with +15 limitations available).
(b) The last "bonus" worked with is a -1.

The order of Bonuses: Item, Slot 3, Slot 2, Slot 1.
So, if you have: {Meat}Evil God Card/Yggdrasil/Yggdrasil
Bonuses will go as follows: {Meat} has no bonuses. Yggdrasil is +1 all. So, now you're still at +20. Next Yggdrasil is +1 all. So, now you're still at +20. Now Evil God Card is -1 all, so now you're at -1.

Default Limitations are -1 ~ +1 (so if you've got -10 all, and then remove the Evil God Card, you'd get back to -1 all, instead).

4. Can you get +20 stats on a wood item?

As has already been said... of course.

Good answers, but I'm looking for a little more on this one.
4. Can you get +20 stats on a wood item?
Why don't the normal methods of getting +20s work, and how do you get around this? 
From: Myst Erik Ery | Posted: 3/5/2003 11:54:53 PM | Message Detail 
The methods don't work because the meats you add at the end will produce Dryad Cards. In order to get the methods to work on woods, you have to have a World Card present (Yggdrasil, of course), and add a World Card-creating item.

For example, get the following (using Bed of Thorn):

(Yggdrasil)
Evil God Card
Yggdrasil
Anything but Bed of Thorn
[ just left: Bed of Thorn ]

Then, add Grave Dirt repeatedly.

The first Grave Dirt will push in the second Yggdrasil, and you'll end with (---)Yggdrasil/Evil God Card/Yggdrasil, because each time you add Grave Dirt, the Dying Earth Card is removed at the end of the step.

Hmm... this whole talk about +20 and woods got me thinking, do items that would produce World cards under normal circumstances create Dryad cards when unable to create the World cards, in a wood material?

If so, it would be practically impossible to get a wood item to +20, since the rotations involve 4 cards (BoT, Ygg x 2, EGC) instead of three. Let's see:

Needle +0
Spiny Seed +0
Poison Claw +1 (total +1)
Spiny Seed +1 -1 (total +1)
Needle +1 -1 +1 (total +2)
Poison Claw -1 +1 (total +2)
Spiny Seed +1 -1 (total +2)
Needle -1 +1 (total +2)
Static LOOP begins

This would make it theoretically impossible to raise bonuses to +20 on wood items, but only if World card-producing items produce Dryad cards in woods, when unable to create a World card.

About your Bellgrapes example... It sounds to me like you're saying that as long as you continually add Bellgrapes in a row, your magic will raise up to +10, which is the bonus limit for Bellgrapes. That much makes sense. Then you're saying that the moment you add another item with limitations below +10, your magic bonus will fall to that limit, wherever it is? Are you sure you don't mean that the bonus will fall after the last Bellgrapes is pushed off? I thought that as long as there is a Bellgrapes somewhere in your card slots, your magic limitation is +10 (assuming there's nothing higher elsewhere).

Marcus- about World Cards in Wood. World Cards will still not appear (according to biquut). Howevr, non-World cards do exactly what you said- if their prerequisites are not fulfilled, they add Dryad cards instead. I don't know if you already know (or care about) this, but I just figured I'd point it out.

I want to temper a DragonScales Shield and DragonScales Armor, but I'm not sure what all to do. I know how to get two Bed of Thorns and Heaven's Scales on them(I did in a test run) but I didn't know if I could get some other uses out of them. I already have a AdamPendant with +20 stats, status immunities,and essense resistances. I atleast want to make the Armor more useful, I prolly won't be using the Shield much since I have the Pendant and a Mantle(2xBoT and a Nymph of Sky).

Shadowangemon... don't make ANYTHING with a Bed of Thorns effect on it or it'll cancel out your Nymph of Sky effect from your mantle. That's the first big mistake I did with armor. Also, there's no point in having Heaven's Scale if you've got Nymph of Sky. It does the exact same thing, and has the unfortunate side effect of preventing you from reviving. The best thing to do is have armor without an effect. (Only pendants, rings, shoes, and mantles can have effects other than Bed of Thorns or Heaven's Scale.) I hope your pendant has a different effect besides Bed of Thorns! 
From: MarcusMajarra | Posted: 3/6/2003 11:48:40 PM | Message Detail 
There's another solution to Bed of Thorn problems:

Just make sure the last special effect added to every item you're using wasn't Bed of Thorn. Heaven's Scales is popular because it's easy to get (Springanana, with no essence level requirements) and because it allows HP Recovery in battle while you're moving (but not while you're not moving). Just make sure the top card on all your armor equipment is Heaven's Scales, and you shouldn't have problems.

From: Vilurum | Posted: 3/7/2003 9:33:05 PM | Message Detail 
Traitor Cat: Bellgrapes is kind of a special case. If it was the last item tempered in, think of it as being like a very temporary card which has a +10 cap for Magic (rather than the default +1). But as soon as the next non-Bellgrapes item goes in, the "last item tempered" is no longer Bellgrapes, so Magic will go to whatever everything else (the new item tempered, and the present cards) allow it to be.

So if the new maximum for Magic is, say, +5, then Magic will drop to +5 as soon as you temper something that's not a Bellgrapes. If you've got an Yggdrasil card around, however, which has limitations of +10 all, then Magic can stay at +10 because it's still within those limitations.

There are a number of other items which work like Bellgrapes as well.

Yes - Bellgrapes is an item, not a Card. ^_^

Some items also have Bonus Limitations (like Bumpkin's +3 Luck).
If you ever add a Bumpkin, and Luck is between -1~+3, you'll find that Luck will immediately go to +3, and not lower to +2 even if there's an Evil God present.

These Item Bonus Limitations are just like Card Bonus Limitations. Major examples are the Evil God Cards -- They have a Bonus Limitation of +15 to one stat, which makes that stat never able to go below +15. If that stat is at +20, then it will still go to +15 when there's a -1 all around, but it will never drop below +15 while there's the Evil God Card present.
That means that, with three Evil God Cards, you can get three stats at +15, and the rest at -10, rather easily. You'd have to choose between WitchOfMoon/Leviathan and GodOfDestruction/LordOfFlies, though (that is, you can't use WitchOfMoon AND GodOfDestruction, without using Ragnarok or Sacrificed Nymph + Consumptions).

Whatever you could get with one card plus a capper (your other two card slots would be an EG and an Yggdrasil). Several hundred attack, if you have high essence levels, though I dunno if it'd be over 500, it'd still be plenty enough.

Alternatively, if you use the 3x Clown + Sharp Claw varnish, Clowns have a limitation of +9 all, which isn't too shabby.

Holy ****! I have absolutely no idea what you guys are talking about. Well, I have some idea, but I got lost in the dust way back there.

*turns around and points to a distant mountain*

Honestly, I really, really, like this game. It is by far one of the most versatile games I've seen on any platform. There's so much you can do. There's almost too much you can do in this game.

I'm currently playing through the game for my 3rd? or maybe my 4th time. Until now, I've stuck with fighting battles with just my weapons (all of which are vizel gold, purchased from Geo). I've decided, though, that I want to go more in-depth. I want to learn the ins and outs of this game. I want to forge weapons, raise killer pets, make wicked golems, make cool intruments, and learn every technique available for every weapon.

I really need to read through some of those FAQs....

Well, if any of you remember, I have been to this board before, and I very distinctly remember my friend Myst Erik Ery. But, it's been a year, or more since I last posted here. It's also been close to a year since I last spoke to Erik.

Anyways, I think I'll go read some FAQs, and (hopefully) learn a few things about this game - especially where it concerns the making of weapons and armor. I will also be keeping closer tabs on this board, and you can expect to be seeing more of me around this place. Thank you.

The basics is at the end of Marcus' faqs:
dryad silver
3 sulpher
dryad silver
needle
2 spiny seed
poison fang
8 spiny seed

On nonwoods you can use meats instead of some of those spiny seeds. But this method is limited because it needs sala=0 to get bed of thorns to get two yggdrasil.

There are ways around the sala=0 limitation, but I don't think they'd work on wood. 
From: Myst Erik Ery | Posted: 3/17/2003 6:11:58 PM | Message Detail 
Getting around the Salamander=0 limitation is impossible on Woods, if you want +20 all, simply because there's no item that both gives +1 all AND creates a World Card.

For the recipe that was given, replace the last hundred Spiny Seeds with Grave Dirts, Springananas, or even Chaos Crystals --- Spiny Seeds are too rare to throw away when there's other World-Card-Making items.

*sighs* If only Yggdrasil and Evil God Cards had the 'Sticky' Flag, like Pixie Cards... Then you could just add Spiny Seed, Evil God Card, and BINGO - add as many Dragon's Blood and Toadstoolsheds you like.

They probably would, actually, push it on (and subsequently disappear). However, it'd be a waste of one of the first pair of Spiny Seeds. Also, unless you're doing this on a wood (in which case you don't wanna use cardless items because they'll give Dryad cards, thus pushing off the cards you want), use meat instead of those later Spiny Seeds.

Meat is much more common, and all you really want to do is temper something in and have the card situation be the same. But since it recalculates going through all the cards again, it'll be [+1] all, [-1] all, [+1] all, for a net gain of +1 all, for each item tempered. Assuming you have Ygg/EG/Ygg.

If you have Ygg/Ygg/EG, it'll be [+1] all, [+1] all, [-1] all, in that order ... meaning that if you start at +15 ([+1] from that is +20, the max), then the first Ygg will take it to +20, the second will have no effect, then the EG will bump it back down to +15.

Adding a Meat after the first Grave Dirt/etc. will likely cause the World Card to go away, since there's a World Card in the invisible Slot and one on the item, and Bed of Thorn isn't present at the start of tempering.

Try that for me, and see if it pushes on a Dying Earth / Heaven's Scale / etc... or not?

On one of the guides for tempering it said something about rinsing and varnishing a weapon. I believe I understand varnishing, but its the Rinsing I'm having trouble understanding. From what I can grasp its suppose to move all unwanted cards off and keep all you put on it?
Does that work with the cards that have plunge attacks or special effect or just get unwanted element cards out of the way? 
From: Myst Erik Ery | Posted: 3/18/2003 6:50:45 PM | Message Detail 
Rinsing is just to remove any lingering TPs or effects from the last few cards added (usually Lilipods are used to rinse).

Plunge Attacks are permanent - once you add a Card to add a Plunge Attack, the Plunge Attack remains until you add a different Plunge Attack over the same slot... So you don't have to worry about losing a Plunge Attack.

Hello all.

I finally got a PS2 and can play my games again, yay. been so long since I got to play LoM. I have to start from scratch though, bummer.

Anyway, was relearning everything again and a tempering question came to mind.

Is it possible to get all immunities and a 99 (or close to 99) defense setup using all 3 armor's (..or less)?

And also (forgive me it's late, and i been reading faqs all day), Do immunities leave with the card? or are they perminant like plunges? or maybe they stay until the essence reqs arn't met anymore..?

hrm, maybe i should sleep and keep going in the morning. laf

Immunities are permanent, except under certain circumstances...

A pendant can get all immunities, all resistances, and still have pretty decent magic defense. See LoM Kitchen's pendant recipe.

As far as Armor goes, grab some Dragonscales Armor, and add:
1 Any Seed
2 Needle
1 Springana
1 Sleepy Eye

I think that makes something like 80~ defenses. 99~ defences is possible with 3x Bed of Thorn, but I wouldn't suggest that (as you won't be able to regenerate HP).

That leaves you with a Ring or a Mantle (I think you can wear Mantles with armor, at least), or another Pendant. If you can wear Mantles, too, I'd make them out of Dragonskin and top it off with Aroma Oil in stead of 1 Sleepy Eye (use the same recipe as above), and 1 White Feather instead of 1 Springanana. That'd make a fairly strong defensive-wise mantle, with fairly good magic-defense, too.

Each piece of armour (by armour, I mean non-weapon equipment) can only have one effect on it. This effect is the last one placed on the armour. If you had a different piece of armour that still had the Bed of Thorns on it, then it would cancel out the Springanana, but if you don't, the Springanana overwrites the Bed of Thorns.

If you make a ring instead, don't use a White Feather, either. Use something else that will give you an even better Effect. For example, Hairball (for extra Lucre).
The White Feather is just to get an even better Effect for your Mantle, which allows you to revive... Though, if you have any other armor with Heaven's Scale, it kinda prevents that...

Hmm.. Perhaps the varnish is wrong.. 3 Bumpkin + Sharp Claw, no?

I would have expected 999.

Yes, 3 bumpkins + sharp claw
Are there any items that can permanently lower a sword's attack power?
Like the few dozens vials of dragon blood i put on it, or the pine o'clock, sleepy eye and moon crystal used to get the plunge attacks?
I'll take a look at it again, like rinse it and varnish again, just to make sure it's been done correctly.

Nope. None of that would have lowered attack power.

It's just surprising, that's all. With such a low Growth Control, and at such high essences, I'd assume you could get 999 with a sword.

If you can get 977 with a sword, then you surely can get 999 with a 2H-Sword...

But I was certain that the only weapons that couldn't get 999 were Flail, Glove, and Staff (which work better with Dragonscales, but still fall short of 999 -- Hammers work better with Dragonscales, too, except that they would reach 999 either way, I think)...

Hmm... Oh well.

If you're just going to use the QuickRecipe as it is, you're going to want to use LorantSilver.

If you ensure that you don't raise Wisp past Shade, however, VizelGold will give you a better result.

You also have to realize that metals are kinda sucky for weapon creation, especially for swords (ironically)... You're better off choosing another material. :)

Ok
So if the quick recipe order was switched to

Aura
Undine
Dryad
Gnome
Shade
Wisp (don't raise above shade)
Sala
Jinn

Are you SURE VizelGold is better than LorantSilver? 
From: Myst Erik Ery | Posted: 4/6/2003 8:09:41 PM | Message Detail 
You don't have to change the order, so long as you don't raise Wisp above Shade.

LorantSilver: 25/25/25/25
VizelGold: 35/35/35/35

Obviously, VizelGold is better.

However, you might have to experiment --- VizelGold's resistances are higher, so you won't be able to get as high essenses... and in addition, its Growth Control is larger than LorantSilver's.

Try both - considering you only lose out on a single silver coin of each element (except Dryad, which you don't lose anything), along with six bumpkins and two sharp claws, two Chaos Crystals, and 10 Mercury and 10 Sulpher...

1. Which prime materials are best for weapons final results, after raising essence levels and such?
DiorWood and Dragonscales.

2. What all does Bed of Thorns effect prevent? Other special effects? HP Drain? Pak'n Choco?
Bed of Thorns Effect prevents HP regeneration, but you can use Elysia's HP Drain Synchro, the Vampsword Plunge, or candy, to heal yourself.

3. What's a good armour combination without bed of thorns effect? (you can have up to 2 beds of thorns without the effect, right?)
If you have, or had, Bed of Thorn on your armor, you'll still have the Bed of Thorn Effect. You can give it another Effect (usually the Heaven's Scale one), but if you add another Bed of Thorn after, it's replaced with the Bed of Thorn one again. Thus, your armor will either avoid Bed of Thorn entirely, or look like this: Heaven's Scale/Bed of Thorn/Bed of Thorn. Armor + Ring + Pendant is usually the best combination, and you can give Rings and Pendants different Effects from the Heaven's Scale one (I prefer Share Experience and Extra Lucre).

For the weapons where you'd use a 3x Cleric + Giant's Horn varnish, you'll probably want to use DragonScales (due to its high heavy stat). For the rest, you'll probably want to use DiorWood, as it improves more with each essence level than DragonScales does.

For physical armor (like Armor :), use DragonScales. For magical armor (like Ring, Pendant, Mantle ...), use Adamantite.

I'd prefer +20 all, anyway, considering HP and Luck aren't going to get near to 99... Luck can only get to 85, with all four +20 equipment... and HP gain is usually very small, so it'd be at 70 tops, usually (without +20 equipment) rather than 90+ like most stats...

LorantSilver's stats will become: 123/1/25/25 for a gain of 74.

As you can see, VizelGold benefits more from varnishing, even if essense raising doesn't benefit it as much.

That's why AltenaFelt and jewels don't make UberWeapons very easily -- their Growth Control is very low (10), but their stats just plain suck ^_^

I'd be good to understand how consumptions work. A twelve on the bottom can get you a fourteen on the top. Once you understand that you can come up with a 999 recipe by yourself.
Also note that an 815 weapon is pretty far down the path of overkill. So tweaking out 15s is more a matter of pride than practicality.

1x Glow Crystal [4
3x Gold Clover [5, 6, 7
3x Glow Crystal
2x Sulpher/Mercury
1x Silver Coin [8

Yes. In fact, the second-to-last Gold Clover can be a 32-energy Cardless item...

However, for the sake of having less different types of items, I tend to just use Gold Clover anyway.

And that's true - Glow Crystals would also work as the final item, since there's a TP from the Essense Card and at least 64 item energy. Any 64 energy Card-making item would work (Applesocks, Flaming Quill, Orange'opus, Dialaurel, Dragon Blood...)

Energy breakdown
Heres a basic energy chart, but refer to marcus' FAQ because the formatting here will be messed up.
__1__2__3__4__5__6__7__8__9_
0|8 14 28 56 112 224 448 896 1792
1|8 8 16 24 48 96 192 384 768
2|8 8 8 8 16 32 64 128 256

Aura Silver (needs 8 energy to get to level 1, has 48) 1
Mercury (needs 14 energy to get to level 2, has 24) 2
Mercury (needs 16 energy with one witch to get to level 3, has 24) 3
Glow Crystal (needs 8 energy with two witches to get to level 4, has 96) 4
Bird Meat (needs 16 energy with two witches to get to level 5, has 16) 5
Gold Clover (needs 32, has 64) 6
Gold Clover (needs 64, has 64) 7

Now for the fun part. 8 and 9 require more energy than is available from a single item. Luckily there is a card that can give use some energy too. This card is the Nymph of Dawn (NoD) and when this card *leaves* the item it gives up 192 energy. It will leave when it is pushed off normally, but it will also leave if a low energy item is added (<32 (like mercury/sulpher)). The good news is that only one will leave at a time.
Anyway, back to our 8 and 9. Using NoD we have available up to 288 energy. This will be enough to get our 8 and 9 if we've got two wizard cards working for us. Each of those wizard cards is going to push off a NoD and we need two others for the 8 and 9. Luckily our material will hold four NoD (one in the item slot). I forgot to mention it earlier but NoD is produced by glow crystals. We already used one, so we need three more.

3 Glow Crystals
2 Mercury
Aura Silver (needs 128, has 192+48) 8
Glow Crystal (needs 256, has 192+96) 9

Notice how the last steps had a lot of prep work to set them up.

No. A single Wizard Card gives resistance 3 on Dragonscales, and resistance three requires the following energy to raise:
3 / 6 / 12 / 24 / 48 / 96 / 192 / 288

So, to get from 7->8, you require 288 energy, which is exactly the same as the amount you get from the Nymph of Dawn which leaves plus the Glow Crystal (prior to adding the Glow Crystal at [8, the cards are (Essense)Wizard/Nymph/Nymph , and so adding the Glow Crystal makes it (Nymph)Essense/Wizard/Nymph ...)...
Actually, it looks like you only need to add one Glow Crystal, rather than two, before the Sulpher/Mercury.. Unless I'm not thinking correctly.

The energy required to get from 8->9 is too large for even Nymph of Dawn to handle, without lowering the resistance from 3 to 1, where it becomes:
1 / 2 / 4 / 8 / 16 / 32 / 64 / 128 / 256
And again you are able to raise it to 9 using a Nymph of Dawn leaving. This time, however, you can use any 64-energy-or-higher item, instead of being forced to use a Glow Crystal of 96 energy.

If you were thinking correctly you wouldn't need either.

glow crystal (the one that pushed on the silver coin)
mercury
shade silver

Leaves you with (glow)/shade/witch/NoD
Adding another glow crystal would give you 288 energy, but it doesn't raise 7->8.
The first NoD doesn't leave even though it was pushed on by a low energy item. Because the pushing on occurs after the pushing off would have.

I've forgotten a lot about tempering.. but even back
when I knew it pretty well, trying to come up with
my own techniques was a serious headache.. I made my
own map recently and that was frustrating enough...

But, for the sake of my pride as a genius, I'll give
it a shot... So my question...

I'm trying to forge a sword with a power of 999.
Could someone help me by explaining how consumption
works? 
From: Myst Erik Ery | Posted: 4/10/2003 12:49:02 AM | Message Detail 
When conditions are right, TPs will trigger consumptions.
When there's a consumption, one Essense will drop by 1 (or more) levels, and you'll get energy equal to the amount of energy required to get to that level, by this formula:
Energy Released = Resistance(note) * 2^(level - 1)
Where level is equal to the level of the Essense before consumption occurs.
Note: Resistance is unmodified by Wizard Cards, and this is why you can use a lower essense to raise another essense to an even higher number.

First, where do the TPs come from, and what conditions

Second, umm... what was the hierarchy of the elements

2H Sword, yes. 1H Sword, I'm not so sure, but it can get near enough to not matter, really...

TPs are generated from either Mystic Cards (namely, the Essense Cards) or items (mostly Coins, but other items provide TPs, too. For example, Mush-in-a-Box provides a Shade TP). Woods have a special TP - there's always a Dryad TP present, unless there's a Bed of Thorn present. Woods are said to be Dryad-sensative, meaning that they provide a Dryad TP each turn. Bed of Thorn negates that sensativity while it is present, however.

Under normal conditions:
Wisp/Shade TPs cause Shade to drain to 0 (getting energy from each level drained) if Wisp>Shade.
Dryad TPs cause Aura to drain if Wisp>Shade.
Aura TPs cause Dryad to drain if Shade>Wisp.
Salamander TPs cause Gnome to drain.
Gnome TPs cause Jinn to drain.
Jinn TPs cause Undine to drain.
Undine TPs cause Salamander to drain.

Under Ancient Moon, there is no consumptions or conflicts.

Under Mirrored World:
Wisp/Shade TPs cause Wisp to drain to 0 (getting energy from each level drained) if Shade>Wisp.
Dryad TPs cause Aura to drain if Wisp<Shade.
Aura TPs cause Dryad to drain if Shade<Wisp.
Salamander TPs cause Undine to drain.
Gnome TPs cause Salamander to drain.
Jinn TPs cause Gnome to drain.
Undine TPs cause Jinn to drain.

That's cool... So a TP only lasts a turn, right? If
you get a TP from an item, it's there the turn you
tempered in the item? Well, what about mystic cards?
Obviously there's a TP when the card is in play,
right? But what about the turn it leaves play? Or
when it's in the invisible slot? Or am I just
completely misinterperating the entire concept?

myst seemed to answer most of this stuff while I was typing
We need consumptions because after level 9 the energy to raise a level gets above 288.

__1__2__3__4__5__6__7__8__9__10__11__12_
0|8 14 28 56 112 224 448 896 1792 3584 7168 14336
1|8 8 16 24 48 96 192 384 768 1536 3072 6144
2|8 8 8 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048

If done properly the energy released by a consumption is equal to the energy it took to raise it there AT FULL RESISTANCE. 
Consuming a level 9 on resistance 7 gives up 1792 energy. We can get 192 from a leaving NoD and 64 from the item we're adding (gold coin). This totals 2048 which is enough to get to level 12. This works well on the bottom row because the TP that triggers the consumption is also used to raise the element.
9 gnome + 9 jinn + sulpher + gnome TP = 10 gnome + 8 jinn

Thats a start but we'll come back to that after we're clear on how you'd get 9 gnome and 9 jinn to start with.
If you start with 9 jinn then any gnome you add will drain the jinn, and if you start with gnome then jinn won't be able to raise. So the trick you'll have to get used to is using chaos crystals to make ancient moon cards. This wonderful card prevents the blocking and draining which was stopping us from getting our nines. Now we get to worry about juggling wizard cards AND ancient moon cards to get things to work. ^_^

TPs from Cards, along with resistance modifiers like Sorcerer and Witch, are applied after movement.

Thus, Cards in the Invisible Slot do not count, but if there's a Card moving from the Invisible Slot to the first Slot, it will count (because then it's in the first slot, rather than the Invisible one, after movement).

Mirrored World and Ancient Moon are special, because they're considered before movement, AND they're considered if they're in the Invisible Slot.
So, if there's either of those entering, leaving, or in the Invisible Slot during Tempering, it'll be counted (except, they will not be counted on the turn you add the Chaos Crystal / Mirror Piece, because before movement, they're not even present).

Item TPs are only present once.

And biquts, those tables are a bit wrong -- all those '8's should be lower than 8, considering that:
Energy Requirement = Resistance * 2^(current level)
And thus, resistance 8 is the first resistance whose energy requires are all 8 or higher (since the energy requirement from 0->1 is equal to the resistance itself).

Yes, there's a formula. Refer to LOM Kitchen for the proper material attributes tables (the ones in my FAQ aren't up to date). You calculate weapon power much like you would calculate armor power (these formulas are in my FAQ). You simply have to take into account the Growth Control (should be in LOM Kitchen as well) to each stat as follows:

New Material Attribute = (GC + Total Essences) * Material Attribute / GC

Multiply this attribute by the proper weapon attribute, add the four up, and you get your final power. If you varnish your weapon (also known as capping in the old days), you need to modify the Material Attribute before applying Growth Control (see above). No Material Attribute can be increased above 255 through varnishing.

They would consume and possibly raise multiple times.
When I go for 12s I use a double consumption to get the 10 and 11 (at the same time). And I use a double consumption to get the 12 (so I don't have to use a gold coin).
More than double isn't usually helpful because then you can't have two wizard cards 
From: Traitor Cat | Posted: 4/10/2003 9:56:03 AM | Message Detail 
Hey, I've got one. A Shade consumption always drains Shade straight to zero, ya? When Shade goes to zero, does it supply all the energy it took for Shade to get to whatever level it was at, or just the amount for the last level? For example, if Shade was consumed at level three, would the energy it provided be calculated as

energy for level 3 + energy for level 2 + energy for level 1

or

energy for level 3?

If Shade provides all its energy, then I see it as possible to get a 15 on any single stat on any weapon. If you were willing to do the lower essences first instead of the higher ones, you could get them all to 15, by draining Shade to provide enough energy to boost the last few under conflict. Or better yet, if you used Mirrored World, you could drain Wisp instead, which is much easier to raise under normal circumstances.
Theoretically, that would allow for straight 15s except for Shade. Did I just revolutionize the world of tempering, or is there something pretty major I'm not taking into consideration? ...or does Shade only provide the energy from its last level?

You do get the energy from all those levels. BUT you can't raise a conflicted element through draining. To get around the conflict you'd need an ancient moon card, but then you couldn't drain anything.

I had a similar question... But what does that mean?
Does that mean you can't raise more than half to 15?
Or you can't raise any? Or you can't raise Wisp? I
don't think I follow.. 
From: MarcusMajarra | Posted: 4/10/2003 1:09:55 PM | Message Detail 
Under certain circumstances, some TPs are worth squat, unless there's Ancient Moon present. An example of this would be when trying to raise Gnome while there are some Sala levels present.

The optimal number of different essences you can raise without Ancient Moon is 6, leaving out two bottom-row essences (Sala and Jinn or Gnome and Undine). The last two can only be raised in the presence of Ancient Moon, and Ancient Moon prevents any and all consumptions. This means that you can't trigger a consumption that would place the energy consumed in an Ancient Moon essence.

Hmm... Can that be done? Maxed out power with great stat

From: Myst Erik Ery | Posted: 4/10/2003 2:40:52 PM | Message Detail 
The only way to have +20 Bonuses is if there's an Evil God Card present. Evil God Cards are -1 all, so you have to either have a +1 all card present, or add a +1 all item to push in the last Cards (that'd be Dragon Blood, I think). However, in either case, you're losing one slot of varnishing.
So you're left with only two slots.

As far as Shade consumption goes... yes, it does indeed give energy for each level drained. Unfortunately, this doesn't help much. Let's assume Resistance 8. Shade is at 7, Wisp is at 8, and we're going to try to raise Wisp to 9 with the Shade consumption.
Shade 7->6 gives 8*2^6=8*64=512
Shade 6->5 gives 8*2^5=8*32=256
Shade 5->4 gives 8*2^4=8*16=128
Shade 4->3 gives 8*2^3=8*8=64
Shade 3->2 gives 8*2^2=8*4=32
Shade 2->1 gives 8*2^1=8*2=16
Shade 1->0 gives 8*2^0=8*1=8
Added up, that's 1016.

Wisp from 8->9 requires 8*2^8=8*256= 2048.
That's not enough at all.
In fact, if you were using that to raise something else from 7->8, you almost couldn't. 7->8 requires 8*2^7=8*128=1024, which is only enough because you're adding an item. But to think - to raise something one level, you drained something else seven levels...

This isn't considering Wizard Cards being around, but still... What useful value of Shade could you get to, if you can't raise it higher than Wisp can rise?
To get from 14->15 on Resistance 1 (that is, with Wizards), it requires 2^14 energy. That's 16384 energy.
You'd have to drain Shade from 11->0 to get that energy, and that's only just barely.

Shade (or Wisp, under Mirrored World) is the only essence that can be drained all at once.

Typically, the energy you receive from a consumption is that of the level you just consumed. If you're draining only once, the energy released is equal to:

Energy = Base Resistance x (2 ^ New Level)

This is of the resistance of the essence you drained.

For example, consuming Aura from 10 to 9 on DiorWood would yield:

Energy = 10 * (2 ^ 9)
Energy = 10 * 512
Energy = 5120

Of course, you add the energy from the item you tempered in to that amount, and any energy from departing Nymph of Dawn cards.

That doesn't matter. I've already explained when things drain - only Wisp/Shade have strange draining properties in that one must be higher than the other to drain, and they drain to 0 rather than just one level.

However, you have to note that:
Salamander won't drain Gnome if Undine is present,
Gnome won't drain Jinn if Salamander is present,
Jinn won't drain Undine if Gnome is present,
and Undine won't drain Salamander if Jinn is present.

Needle
Mirror Piece
Sulpher

Honey Onion

My logic was that the bed of thorns would prevent the
sulpher from fiving a Dryad TP while Mirrored World was
in play. So Mirrored World wouldn't be taken advantage 
of until the turn it was discarded, when Dryad would
drain Aura. I was hoping (didn't really expect it to
work) that Aura would drop 1 point, and Dryad would go
up 3. Since the Aura point would give me 9216 energy
which is more than enough to bump Dryad from 8 to 11.

It didn't work. Aura dropped to 9 and Dryad only went
up to 10. Why didn't it work, and why did I get the
effects that occurred?

Dryad back up using the bottom row?

Resistances play a bit into consumptions, but since you can use Wizard cards to reduce the energy requirements for the essences you want to increase, the difference becomes negligible.

For example, on DiorWood, with 2 Witch cards, you can drain a level 15 Dryad to boost Aura from level 14 to level 15, and still have over 30000 energy left for any other TPs. AsianGrinch demonstrated this in his Ultimate DiorWood recipe (15/15/15/14/15/7/15/9).

He triggered these consumptions by making sure that Shade was higher than Wisp, and tempered sequences that resemble the following:

Waterstone (Undine TP with no use, but produces an Undine card)
Mercury
Mercury
Garlicrown (has an innate Aura TP)

He would later drain Aura using Mirrored World to bring Dryad back to level 15, and use the residual energy from the consumption to raise another essence in the same fashion.

The trick to making high-level consumptions do great stuff is to simply exchange the energy around like crazy and using the leftovers to raise other stuff.

I'd ditch the piece of dior wood and work on dragonscale until you understand consumptions better. Dragonscale is almost a perfect material, everything is a low resist and everything except sala is a 7. You can use cardless items and you don't have to worry about dryad swiping your energy.
With wisp=shade, aura=11, and undine=9:

3 glow crystals
2 mercury
aura silver
jinn gold

will get you to aura=12.

You should raise Salamander, and drain it with Undine.
Undine TPs are present in Spiny Carrots, and you can use those to trigger the consumption.
Simply raise Salamander as high as you can (by draining Gnome and so on), and then (after making sure Gnome=0) simply add SilverCoin (of the Essense on the upper row you want to raise), 3x Wizard-Item (or 2x Wizard-Item and one Card Item), and then 1 Spiny Carrot. Alternately, use Fishy Fruit for the TP - that way, you can have a Bed of Thorn leaving at the same time, which should remove the Dryad TP that you might want, since Fishy Fruit makes the Spring Card.

Yes and No.
The formulas given earlier were for low resist materials. Those only take two wizard cards to max out. High resists take 3 wizard cards, so it takes more steps, but it can still be done. And once you're there you'll have more energy to release, 10*2^X instead of 7*2^X.

Raising Sala will be more difficult, but it's pretty easy to do still. If you can raise it to 12, you can drain that to get another essense up to 15. 10*2^11 (20480) > 2^14 (16384). This will, in fact, work as long as Salamander Resistance is 8 or more, not just 10.
So if you can get Sala to 12 by draining Gnome, then you can raise any other thing to 15, provided it has enough Wizard Cards to act like Resistance 1 (which means 4-7 requires 2 Wizard Cards, 8-12 requires 3 [unfortunately]).
So you can't get Shade/Aura to 15 (you can get them to 14, I think) using this on DiorWood...

But I think it's simpler to drain Salamander no matter what the material, since Undine has single-TP items.

You can't.
Once you raise both in a pair (Sala-Jinn or Undine-Gnome), you can't drain either.

Hypothetically, let's say there was an item that gave
you a million billion energy... Could you keep pumping
up essence levels higher and higher, or are they capped
off somewhere?
The reason I asked is because I once drained an essance
for 1 point, causing 2 others to go up by a point each.
How high could I get the levels if I kept doing that
repeatedly?

I was trying to drain Aura 1 point by using a Mirrored
World card (shade > wisp) but Aura dropped before I
wanted it to, probably because I'm working on a piece

this, but... Sala is at 11.. Any suggestions? 
From: MarcusMajarra | Posted: 4/12/2003 2:59:13 AM | Message Detail 
At this point, the only solution is to consume Sala entirely if you ever want Aura to stick. Sala prevents Bed of Thorn, and all items provide a Dryad TP on DiorWood.

Get rid of Sala (preferably by recycling the energy into something more useful, like Aura and Undine), and save it for last.

7. It's the best we've got, and I doubt anyone can bring it higher, on the account that we need Bed of Thorn to achieve 15/15/14/14 with two 15's in the bottom row.

My thoughts are that if you could bring Sala and Jinn

You could drain from either Aura or Dryad, since they

From: Okk | Posted: 4/13/2003 1:47:59 AM | Message Detail 
Just to make sure I have this absolutely clear...
If I drain 1 point from Aura, then I drain no less
than 4, 1 for each turn Mirrored World is in play.
If Wisp is higher than Shade, Aura will be drained
constantly. The only way to drain Aura by only 1 
point is with a Chaos Moon. But Chaos Moon is a
world card, and I can only have 1 of those in play
at a time.. Bed of Thorns, the only way around that
world card rule, requires Sala to be at 0, and THAT
is why Sala is only 7 in the ultimate formula..
Is that right?
I'm probably not the first person to think of a
dozen ways around this, none of which ended up
working.. But I can't help but think there's a way.
Aura and Dryad both have items that give TPs without
pushing a TP card.. So does Undine (which drains
sala.)
Someone out there who understands tempering better
than I, think on this, because I give up. I am,
after all, just a rookie when it comes to tempering.
It's not likely that I could outdo the 'ultimate'
formula.
Speaking of which, where can I find that formula? 
From: Myst Erik Ery | Posted: 4/13/2003 2:27:57 AM | Message Detail 
Um... You can't drain anything under Ancient Moon, and you do not want to have Wisp>Shade ever, unless you want Shade to drain to 0 next time you try to do anything with Wisp/Shade.

The thing is, you have: 0/1/14/14/0/12/0/9
Now, Aura will drain Dryad when you add an Aura TP. So, add an Aura TP when there's a Gnome TP as well, and you get:
0/1/13/15/0/13/0/9.
Then, using Mirrored World, drain Aura by 1 level with Dryad, again when there's a Gnome TP:
0/1/14/14/0/14/0/9
Then, add an Aura TP when there's a Gnome TP as well, and you get:
0/1/13/15/0/15/0/9
Do the same steps as above, but using Undine TPs instead of Gnome ones, and you end up with:
0/1/14/14/0/15/0/15
Then you can raise Shade, Salamander, and Jinn as high as they can go:
0/9/14/14/7/15/9/15
Now, drain Aura/Dryad again until you get Shade up to 15.
0/15/14/14/7/15/9/15
Now drain Aura/Dryad again, to raise Wisp instead.
15/15/14/14/7/15/9/15.
Voila.

It's a tad bit more complicated but...

The idea behind using the ancient moon, in this case,
is that it would prevent all draining while it was in
play.. If the next card after it was Mirrored World,
then Mirrored World would only be in effect 1 turn: the
turn it left play. Isn't that clever? I came up with it
all by myself.. (but i probably wasn't the first one to
come up with it...) But they're both world cards,
which is why Sala has to be zero.. 
From: Myst Erik Ery | Posted: 4/13/2003 2:47:53 AM | Message Detail 
Or you could simply only add the TP on one turn...
Considering there's non-Essense-Card Aura-TP items (Garlicrown), you can use that to get a one-turn drain.
For a one-turn Dryad Drain, you could use Spiny Seeds (which don't make a Dryad Card)..

From: Myst Erik Ery | Posted: 4/13/2003 3:38:23 AM | Message Detail 
Not really.
15/0/15/0 is what you're aiming to get, right? If so, the only thing that you can do, as far as I know, is drain Aura/Dryad. You can't drain Wisp/Shade, since then they'll drain to 0, and they can only drain when one is higher than the other, so you'll constantly have to raise one higher and higher, until you're stuck with one at 15... Besides, 9->0 doesn't give enough energy to get to 15, anyway, and you'd probably want to get Wisp/Shade to 15 using Salamander anyway.

You can't drain Gnome/Undine, since you have to drain something that's at 12 to get to 15...
IF you raise Gnome to 12 by draining Jinn, you still wouldn't be able to use it to get Salamander to 15, since you can only get Salamander to 7 with Ancient Moon and then you'd drain Gnome to less than 12 by the time Salamander got anywhere near 14.

So the only way to raise lower-row essenses to 15 is through upper-row draining, and the only way to raise upper-row essenses to 15 is through lower-row draining to get them to 14 (so they can then drain each other to get to 15, along with the lower row).

Okay, I get it.. So getting anything better than the
ultimate formula on dior wood is, in theory, 
impossible.
But this is all because of the inate Dryad TP, right?
It would be possible if you could drain Dryad one
point at a time with Sala above zero... Is that
correct?

Well, what about Dragon Scales then? It doesn't have
the inate Dryad TP to get in the way, so (since dryad
and aura both have TP items that don't push TP cards)
you could get it to 15/15/15/14/15/9/15/9.. Is that
right?
That's 2 essence points above Dior Wood's best.. Why
is Dior Wood generally preferable, if not for 
potential essence levels?

15/15/15/14/15/9/15/9 is indeed the maximum on Dragonscales.
Unfortunately, because DiorWood has a better Growth Control, a few essense points isn't about to make Dragonscales better. Only Staves, Gloves, and Flails will be better on Dragonscales (and Hammers, but they'll reach 999 on either, really).

Okk, about the Dryad innates in woods, the Bed of Thorn cancels out innate TPs in woods. This is why we can't temper Sala energy until the very end, because we need Bed of Thorn to make sure we don't wind up with any unwanted Aura consumptions under Mirrored World.

But your Ancient Moon theory could work. It's just pointless in DiorWood.

No, that's not right. MMajarra's FAQ is grossly in error on this subject, to tell the truth.

Simply take the largest Limitations (positive and negative) from all three visible Cards.
Thus, if you have an Evil God Card present, you have the potential for +20 all.

Unfortunately, since you can't get higher than +20 [15], if you ever try to go higher than that, it won't. And since Bonuses are applied in a strict order (Item, Card 3, Card 2, Card 1), if your +1 All is done before or -1 All (Evil God Card), you'll end up increasing +20 to +20, and then lowering it to +15.

All items can raise your stats, if you have a +1 All Card. If you have a +1 All Card and a -1 All Card (as in Yggdrasil + Evil God Card), you'll need another +1 All in order to get +20 All in the end. You can get this either from another Yggdrasil Card (and then add meats or anything else you'd like that's Cardless), or from Toadstoolsheds or Dragon Blood (which are both +1 potentially cardless items).

Okay, so if I had cards set like this:

Yggy

Then my stats would get raised twice by the Yiggy cards,
only to be lowered immediately after? But suppose I set
them in this order:

Yggy
Evil God
Yggy

Then I could bring them up to 20 again, right? Well, that
second Yggdrazil is taking up a valuable card slot.. Could
I push it off using another Evil God, and still retain the
+20s? 
From: Myst Erik Ery | Posted: 4/13/2003 4:51:55 PM | Message Detail 
Yes. In that first example, you get +20, and then add one to it to get +20, and then add one to it to get +20, and then subract one from it to get +15.
In the second example, you add one to it to get +20, then subtract one from it to get +15, and then add one to it to get +20 again.

You can push off the second Yggdrasil Card (if it's Ygg/Evil God/Ygg) with anything you'd like, and you'd still have +20 all.

So you can end with (Anything)Card/Ygg/Evil God, and have +20 all. Unfortunately, you'll only get two spots for affecting your weapon/armor --- the Card Slot, and the item you added to push in that Card (or the item you added after pushing in that Card, if it's Cardless).

Evil Gods are -1 All. If you add another Evil God Card, your stats will plummet, since then it'll be (Card)Evil God/Ygg/Evil God, and end up subtracting 1. Then it'll be (Whatever)Card/Evil God/Ygg, and end up never at +20 even if you add Toadstoolsheds, since the Evil God Card is the last one with bonuses (and they're -1 all). Adding another Card will make it worse - back to -1 all again.

I'm feeling better. I can't hear out of my right ear very well, though, which is somewhat bothersome. Mostly I'm exhausted from an extended Drama run >_> Grr..

The Evil God Cards represent the following sins and demons of the sins, as shown in my list below. Note that these aren't necessarily Christian, but if you do some searches, it's out there at least.

Fallen Angel - Lucifer, the Demon of Pride. The Charm Bonus Limitation fits well with this, and we all know that Lucifer is, indeed, the Fallen Angel.
Wings of Darkness - Mammon, the Demon of Avarice. Biggest factor, really, is the Golden Touch plunge. How's that for shady dealings, eh? Greed indeed.
Beast-Headed God - Belphegore, the Demon of Sloth. Belphegore is seen as a man with the head of a goat, or something like that, which isn't quite like the feline-looking face of the Beast-Headed God. However, Poison Fang and Poison Blade Plunge show how lazy this Card really is. ;)
God of Destruction - Satan, the Demon of Wrath. C'mon. If I have to explain this one, I'll beat you. Interesting that it's depicted as a woman, though.
Leviathan - Leviathan, the Demon of Envy. Leviathan is already the Demon of Envy, and is depicted as a giant snake, just as the Card. There's no denying this one.
Lord of Flies - Beelzebub, the Demon of Gluttony. This one is practically already named Beelzebub, and the Quick Knife Plunge might be referring to an ability to cut your meat faster, or something. Heh.
Witch of Moon - Baal or Asmodeus, the Demon of Lust. I've seen both names, though I'm partial to Asmodeus. She's a girl, for starters, and she gives the Vampsword Plunge Attack, which has the same effect as a Succubus' Synchro... And we all know what Succubi are reknowned for.

Okk... for DiorWood-type weapons, use Clown Cards and top it off with a Sharp Claw. For Dragonscales-type weapons, use Cleric Cards and top it off with a Giant's Horn.

Exception is axes. Give them Volcano Cards and top them off with scissors.

Didn't we already have this debate? I went to the LoM Kitchen and looked at the card sprite, and I SWEAR that the depiction of the God of Destruction does NOT include breasts!!!!!

(He DOES, however, appear to have the highly pronounced pectoral muscles of a very strong male, such as might be seen in those Bowflex-esque commercials that advertise home gym equipment.......)

Yes. -1~+1 is the default for all Card Limitations. Don't confuse Limitations and Bonus Limitations, however. Bonus Limitations are special Limitations that make a special minimum for a stat. A good example is the Evil God Cards -- while they are indeed -1 all, they have +15 Bonus Limitation to one stat. For example, with Beast-Headed God present, you can't get below +15 HP.

Myst, drag that mind of yours up out of the sewer! That isn't a "boob," it's his right shoulder! The reason you probably thought it was a breast is because he is standing at such an angle that if you looked at him the right (wrong?) way, his shoulder might appear to be a rather demented breast. His right arm is up over his shoulder holding that gigantic red sword, and a lock of his hair is flowing in front of his shoulder joint so that it doesn't look like his arm is connected to his shoulder.

No "Package"

Come on, now..... do you really think that Squaresoft would put something like that in a "T" - rated game????? Even on male characters who aren't wearing anything, they tend to be depicted without that "package." 

Long Hair

Have you ever watched any anime? 90% of the guys in anime (and manga, and otaku, and just about every other style of cartoon/comic drawing) have long hair. It's added for dramatic effect, apparently. Plus, long hair doesn't necessarily indicate a female; I know plentyof guys with long hair (although only one or two of them have hair THAT long)... Look at Escad! Look at Irwin! And from other games, look at Sephiroth (he's the epitome of long hair on a male character). Look at Vincent (from the same game). And there are plenty of other examples.

It means you revive faster.

Other Effects (that I don't have listed over at LoM Kitchen) either do nothing, or nobody knows what they do -- and they aren't given by any Card.

Immunities do not cancel each other. Pine o'Clock removes all status except for Sleep (which it grants), and Stinky Breath removes all status except for Poison and Confusion (which it grants). If you don't add either of these two itesm, all status immunities will remain on armor.

You must be crazy. "Movement Animations" only show when Card Compositions change, so if your cards didn't change, there was no animation.

As far as keeping the immunity - simple. The Fertility Goddess Card was still present, so it added the Petrify Immunity again, after you removed it with the Rhinoloupe.

Ragnarok

If you temper in an Eye, you'll get (Pixie)Card/Card/Card, since Ragnarok is only taken into account before movement, though it counts the invisible slot. If you had:
(Pixie)Card/Card/Ragnarok, it would become (Card)EvilGod/Card/Card if you add a Card-Making Item.
It does Ragnarok's transformations after finding out stickiness, however, since (Ragnarok)Card/Card/Pixie will become:
(Card)Ragnarok/Card/EvilGod.

(Yggdrazil)
Leviathan
Yggdrazil
Bed of Thorns

Adding a Springanana will make (Heaven's Scale)Yggdrasil/Leviathan/Yggdrasil, since there's a Bed of Thorn present before movement. If you add a cardless item after that, you'd get (---)Yggdrasil/Leviathan/Yggdrasil. However, on Woods, there ARE no cardless items. So on a Wood item, you have to have this:
(Yggdrasil)Leviathan/Yggdrasil/Card
By adding the Spiny Seed when Bed of Thorn leaves. Now, add Grave Dirt (etc.) constantly to boost up your stats, since it is not Cardless (it adds the Dying Earth Card, but removes it afterwards).

I hope I'm not annoying all of you with stupid questions..
But if I am, I'd like to point out that they are not
stupid questions, they are very smart questions. If you
remember, with the help of the wonderful people on this
board I came to understand several compicated aspects of
tempering, and rather quickly. Tempering is the sort of
thing that requires a certain degree of intelligence to
understand (a lot, actually) so just for getting as far
as I am, I feel pretty dang smart.

But enough about that...
I have a method to solve my problem.. First I level up 
Wisp until it is even with Shade. After this I repeatedly
raise Sala to 12, and drain it into Aura of Dryad. When
one of these two reaches 15 and the other 14, I stop..
raise Shade higher than Wisp again, and raise my other 
essences by moving that 1 point back and forth..
But that would require evening out shade and wisp.. and
also draining Undine back down again and raising Sala
(which I just undid.. ><) and raising Gnome to level 9
over and over and over.... Is there any alternative? 
From: MarcusMajarra | Posted: 4/20/2003 4:17:34 PM | Message Detail 
It's much easier to use the high levels of Undine attained through leftovers from Aura and Dryad consumptions to make both Aura and Dryad gain levels at the same time. It's pretty easy on DiorWood, since Dryad requires so little energy.

The trick is making sure you keep Shade and Wisp as low as possible when you need to do this, and keep them both equal.

Here's an excerpt from AG's Ultimate DiorWood:

Base levels: 1/1/10/11/0/0/0/12

Mirror Piece (1/1/10/11/0/0/0/12)
Aura Silver (1/1/10/11/0/0/0/12)
Mercury (1/1/10/11/0/0/0/12)
Mercury (1/1/10/11/0/0/0/12)
Firestone (1/1/11/12/1/0/0/11)

As you can see, the Undine consumption provides enough energy to raise both Aura and Dryad one notch. The following steps involve having Undine drained once to raise Dryad twice:

Big Seed (1/1/11/12/1/0/0/11)
Big Seed (1/1/11/12/1/0/0/11)
Mirror Piece (1/1/11/12/1/0/0/11)
Big Seed (1/1/11/12/1/0/0/11)
Sulpher (1/1/11/12/1/0/0/11)
Sulpher (1/1/11/12/1/0/0/11)
Firestone (1/1/13/12/2/0/0/11)

That's four levels gained (plus the two little Sala levels) gained from just two Undine levels. What's more is that with the new Dryad and Aura levels (after raising Shade by one point), the Dryad and Aura consumptions provide enough leftover energy to boost Undine all the way to 14. After that, repeating similar processes as those seen above can raise Dryad to 15 and Aura to 14, which is great to make any essence reach 15 through leftovers.

There is still one thing that concerns me.. At the end
of that first procedure, you used a firestone. Wouldn't
that push a Sala card? Thus giving a TP which will drain
Undine, at the very least, 1 more level?

Only raise Wisp when Mirrored World isn't present, then.

Wisp and Shade both cause Wisp/Shade consumptions. So you're going to have to raise Wisp using a Dryad consumption, since with Aura, Wisp'll drain to 0.

Just get it so you have 15 Dryad and 14 Aura, and drain Dryad and add Wisp at the same time, getting you 14 Dryad, 15 Aura, and 15 Wisp. I believe that's possible, even with a limited number of Wizard Cards (and remember, Wisp is funny with Wizard Cards). You wouldn't be able to raise Wisp under Mirrored World anyway, since Shade is present.

I just checked. Yes, it's possible -- you'll need one of each Wizard Card, though.
You're going to have to set it up like this:
(Wisp)Sorcerer/Witch/[Card]

And then add a Garlicrown.

Energy: 5 * 2^14 = 81920
Need: 6 * 2^13 + 3 * 2^13 = 9 * 2^13 = 73728
More than enough. You'll have 8182 left.

Myst, aren't those calc's to get Wisp/Aura to 14? Not 15.

To get to 15 while only using 1 wizard for both Wisp/Aura. Wisp would need 49152, and Aura would need 98304. Thats way more energy than Dryad can dish out. 
From: MarcusMajarra | Posted: 4/21/2003 1:33:18 PM | Message Detail 
Indeed. This is why Ultimate DiorWood can only have 14 in both Dryad and Aura.

Anyway, so long as Wisp < Shade, you can raise Shade normally. Just transfer leftover energy from Dryad/Aura consumptions onto Shade (this does wonders under Mirrored World, since Dryad TPs generate Aura consumptions with Shade > Wisp).

Anyway, make sure your top row is 14/15/14/15, then finish raising Undine, then raise Gnome to 15, then make the final consumption to get your top row to be 15/15/14/14, then raise Sala and Jinn under Ancient Moon.

And there you have Ultimate DiorWood.

Oh, I thought I was going for 15-15-14-15. My mistake.
So is 15-15-14-14 actually preferable to 14-15-14-15 in
any practical way, is it purely aesthetic?

I added a Garlicrown. After movement, I had a Wisp card,
a Sorcerer card, and a Witch card.

Dryad was drained one point.. but Aura did not go up,
it stayed at 14. Wisp went up 1 point... from 7 to 8.

Why?

I'm in no hurry.. Since I forgot to save after buying
the sword from myself, I have to work Gnome and shade
back up again.. from my old backup...

I think that would still make for a better sword than
Dragonscales with Sala at 9.. Is this accurate?

Considering you can't varnish worth squat if you go for the +20 route, I'd say you're better off just with +9 all...

+20 ALL stats is only possible on wood with zero sala, but you can get +20 luck on wood with whatever sala you want.

That would require using Ragnarok + Pixie (Evil God) + Aura + Sacrificed Nymph.

Assuming Shade=Wisp...

Pine o'Clock
Non-Wicked Eye
Aura Silver
Aura Silver
Ghost's Howl
Aura Silver
Aura Silver
Ghost's Howl

and so on, until you get around [14] or so.
Each turn, Luck increases by [+1], since there's -1 +1 +1 from the Evil God Card and two Aura Cards.

Finish with:

Aura Silver
Aura Silver
Ghost's Howl
Aura Silver
Varnish Card
Varnish Item

Which will leave you with (Dryad_)VarnishCard/Aura/Evil God

Something like that. I was thinking just use an aura card in place of the usual 2nd yggdrasil then use the cardless world card trick. Most stats stay the same, luck goes up.
Oh, and you could get a 20 in whatever the EGC was too. 
From: Myst Erik Ery | Posted: 4/30/2003 9:01:45 PM | Message Detail 
That's true -- you could just use an Aura Card along with the Yggdrasil. It'd be easier, and give you slightly better stats...

Both will work if you just want +20 Luck, however.

I'm trying a lorantsilver spear with 50 essence, 3clown, sharp claw.

25 25 25 25 lorantsilver, 12 growth control
52 20 24 48 spear

[[[25*1.5^4]*62/12]*52/128]+... gives me 336 but its only 331 when I make it.

25 25 25 25 lorantsilver, 12 growth control
52 20 24 48 spear

50 Essences

4x Sharp +50%
4x Heavy -50%

int(25 * 1.5) = 37
int(37 * 1.5) = 55
int(55 * 1.5) = 82
int(82 * 1.5) = 123

int(25 * 0.5) = 12
int(12 * 0.5) = 6
int(6 * 0.5) = 3
int(3 * 0.5) = 1

New values: 123/1/25/25

I keep getting 329 or 330, but not 331... >_>
Perhaps I'm just rounding in the wrong places.

I know that you're going to have to multiply 123/1/25/25 with 52/20/24/48, and divide by 128, and also multiply by 62/12...

(123 * 62/12) * (52 / 128) = 258.171875
(1 * 62/12) * (20 / 128) = 0.80729166666666
(25 * 62/12) * (24 / 128) = 24.21875
(25 * 62/12) * (48 / 128) = 48.4375
Total = 331.63541666666666666

Aha. Without rounding, it's close. If I round the end result, I end up with 258 + 24 + 48 = 330...
Strange...

>_> Why can't I remember the steps the game takes to calculate attack power?

Are you sure the Total Essence Level is 50 and not 49 instead?

I keep getting 336 attack for 50 essences, and 330 for 49 essences, but I'm wondering if the Heavy Stat, despite being .78125, if it infact defaults to adding 1, which would give a 331 attack power (assuming 49 essences) 
From: Locarte | Posted: 5/2/2003 2:10:10 PM | Message Detail 
For the heck of it.

Dragonskin 35 1 1 1
Growth 20
2handedSword 40 40 40 40

Base Attack Power is 11

((35*40)/128) = 10.9375

((1*40)/128) = .3125

((1*40)/128) = .3125

((1*40)/128) = .3125

Add Clown Card, Attack Power goes to 16
(35*1.5)= 52.5

((52*40)/128) = 16.25

((.5*40)/128) = .15625

((1*40)/128) = .3125

((1*40)/128) = .3125

Clown/Clown/Clown, Attack power now is 37

((118*40)/128) = 36.875

((.125*40)/128) = .0390625

((1*40)/128) = .3125

((1*40)/128) = .3125

AltenaAlloy 50/50/50/50
Total Essence 102
Growth 18
Spear 52/20/24/48
Attack Power is 873

(((18+102)*253)/18) = 1686 ((1686*52)/128) = 684.9375

(((18+102)*3)/18) = 20 ((20*20)/128) = 3.125

(((18+102)*50)/18) = 333 ((333*24)/128) = 62.4375

(((18+102)*50)/18) = 333 ((333*48)/128) = 124.875

684+3+62+124 = 873 (Matches)
684.9375+3.125+62.4375+124.875 = 875.375

Now back to the original (assuming 49 essences)

(((12+49)*126)/12) = 640 ((640*52)/128) = 260

(((12+49)*1)/12) = 5 ((5*20)/128) = .78125

(((12+49)*25)/12) = 127 ((127*24)/128) = 23.8125

(((12+49)*25)/12) = 127 ((127*48)/128) = 47.625

260+0+23+47 = 330

260 + .78125 + 23 + 47 + The decimal of either Force/Tech Result will bump attack power up an extra point.

Conclusion:
If Result > 0 AND Result < 1
then add Result to the decimal value of any other Type Result that'll add an extra point in damage. (Do NOT add all decimals together, only ONE other value that would result in a bump in attack power)

Proof: (Still Pending)
Pearl 2/2/2/2
2handed Sword 40/40/40/40
Attack power after Forge 2

((2*40)/128) = .625

((2*40)/128) = .625

((2*40)/128) = .625

((2*40)/128) = .625

int(.625+.625) + int(.625+.625) = 2

Further Proof:
My Dragonskin 2handed sword above with 1 clown card
16.25 + .15625 + .3125 + .3125 = 17.03125

However game considers it an Attack Power of 16 instead.

Is it possible to get Centaur Hide in game as a 2hander sword? That would probably verify it even further. 
From: Locarte | Posted: 5/2/2003 3:24:26 PM | Message Detail 
Hmmm...

Pearl 2hander Sword with total essence of 2 comes out to be Attack Power 3.

(((8+2)*2)/8) = 2.5 ((2.5*40)/128) = .78125

(((8+2)*2)/8) = 2.5 ((2.5*40)/128) = .78125

(((8+2)*2)/8) = 2.5 ((2.5*40)/128) = .78125

(((8+2)*2)/8) = 2.5 ((2.5*40)/128) = .78125

Now with 5 essences it goes up to attack power 4

(((8+5)*2)/8) = 3.25 ((3.25*40)/128) = 1.015625

(((8+5)*2)/8) = 3.25 ((3.25*40)/128) = 1.015625

(((8+5)*2)/8) = 3.25 ((3.25*40)/128) = 1.015625

(((8+5)*2)/8) = 3.25 ((3.25*40)/128) = 1.015625

With 4 Essences it comes back as attack power 3

(((8+4)*2)/8) = 3 ((3*40)/128) = .9375

(((8+4)*2)/8) = 3 ((3*40)/128) = .9375

(((8+4)*2)/8) = 3 ((3*40)/128) = .9375

(((8+4)*2)/8) = 3 ((3*40)/128) = .9375

*boggled*

I think I just confused myself...

Oh well, here are some rough estimates for lorant silver weapons with 50 essences. Actual values for the ones I've tested are in ()s.

hammer 446 (438)
2Haxe 405
spear 336 (331)
axe 308
2Hsword 284
knife 283
flail 275
staff 271
bow 263
glove 242
sword 227

Assuming you don't want to use ash, axes still get to 284/248 when tempered for heavy instead of force.

So swords are worse than anything else after varnishing. This is true regardless of essence level, but not for every material.

Myst, you figured it out but didn't believe yourself :p

After doing some examples...

The ONLY time the game Truncates is EACH Material stat modifier. It does take into consideration the decimal values of each Finalized Stat.

Example: Lorant Silver 25/25/25/25

Mod Slash with 3 clowns and 1 Sharp Claw

The game doesn't mod it in this fashion: 25*1.5^4 = 126.5

However I believe it to be

int(int(int(int(25*1.5)*1.5)*1.5)*1.5) = 123

Now lets calculate the Lorant Silver Spear.

Slash
(((((12+50)*123)/12)*52)/128) + 
Heavy
(((((12+50)*1)/12)*20)/128) +
Force
(((((12+50)*25)/12)*24)/128) +
Tech
(((((12+50)*25)/12)*48)/128) 

Equals: 331.635416667 (Match)(You had it Myst)

Now lets calculate the Lorant Silver Hammer which was also verified at 438.

Slash
(((((12+50)*1)/12)*8)/128) + 
Heavy
(((((12+50)*123)/12)*72)/128) +
Force
(((((12+50)*25)/12)*64)/128) +
Tech
(((((12+50)*25)/12)*16)/128) 

Equals: 438.520833333 (Match)

And finally, lets move onto a different material and see if it holds.

AltenaAlloy Spear
102 essences
Verified: 873 Attack

Slash

For an good Forbidden Ring with high magic defences, three immunities and the Fertility Goddess ability. 

btw, i don't want to use Bed of Thorns cause i want the HP recovery. Also, i don't realy need that much essence raising considering it an armor.

Thx alot for the help!

Which three immunities were you trying to get? Because you're using items which could get 5, but you're only ending up with two.

Since this is a ring not a robe the dialaurals aren't doing anything good for you. The stinky breath and pine oclock both clear immunities, so the flameburst goes away because the dialaurals pushed off the ocean god card. You get to keep the petrify because the fertility goddess is still there. The chaos crystal is a rather expensive way to push on the dryad card, sulpher would probably be a better choice.

Stare attacks -(Wisdom Goddess) Aroma Oil Total 6+

As long as nothing clears them they'll stay, but pine oclock, stinky breath and rhinolaupe all clear immunities when they're added. If the card which causes the immunity is still present it will stay, but the other ones will go away.
But basically theres no way to get the immunities from both pine oclock and stinky breath because they clear the other out.

I finds its easiest to put all immunities on a pendant and always wear it.
Stinky Breath <- (black pixie) <- Confusion/Poison
holy water (to get rid of the pixie)

Ghost Howl <- Sacrificed Nymph <- Petrification
Zombie Claw <-- Paralysis
Blackened Bat <-- Darkness

This question is going to show how new I am to the game, but how do you get an evil god card or Yggdrasil?
Yggdrasil is produced by a spiny seed if dryad is 5 or higher. But its a world card, which means it will try to get rid of itself if other world cards are present. Theres a lot to world cards so tell us if you want to know more.

Evil god cards produced directly from items require one essence to be 5 or higher and another to be at zero. Check out marcus's FAQs for which items/essences. They can be produced indirectly from pixies when the ragnarock card is present.

The Holy Water there wouldn't get rid of the Pixie. You have to add the Holy Water when the Pixie is in the third slot, ready to leave --- the Holy Water's 'unsticky' property only exists the turn you add the Holy Water; the Cleric Card does nothing to Pixies.

Adding those items will result in: (Sorcerer)Sorcerer/Salamander/Pixie
Unfortunately.

ok another question,
i was following and modifying a bit the cardless tempering on the LoM kitchen with dragonscales(knife) and i came up with this 

...... (Wisp, Shade, Dryad, Aura, Undine, Gnome- 7 Sala- 4 and one mercury before)
Jinn Sliver--> Jinn 1
Aura Sliver --> Jinn 2
Meat --> Jinn 3
Acid --> Jinn 4
Gold CLover --> Jinn 5
Spiny Seed --> Jinn/Aura/Pixie
Pine o'clock --> Aura/Evil God Card/Yagdracill(sp?)

my question is can i add a bunch of meats and cardless stuff to get +20 bonuses? If not can someone help me? I looked at the first page but it was all with Bed of Thorns and i don't want to drain Sala. Plz help, i know there must be a way...... Also, plz tell me if there are any mistakes and stuff so that i can change it, thx alot!

You'll need one Evil God Card.

You'll need one Yggdrasil.

Now, if Sala is less than 3, you can add Dragon's Blood over and over until you get to +20 all.

If Sala is more than 3, you have to use Toadstoolsheds.

Unfortunately, what you're doing doesn't work because you have two World cards present on your item at the same time (Ragnarok and Yggsdrasil). The only way to get them both on at the same time would be to use the Bed of Thorn card, which requires for Sala to be at 0. In order for this to work, you need to space out your Ragnarok from your Evil God:

Pine O'Clock
(any non-cardless item)
(any non-cardless item)
Sleepy Powder (or any Pixie-generating item)
Spiny Seed
Bumpkin
(any non-cardless item)
Dragon Blood (as needed)
Sharp Claw

This way, I believe it should work. If, by any chance, the Spiny Seed doesn't cause Ragnarok to be pushed out (I'm not certain on this one), add a Ghost's Howl right after the Sleepy Powder.

If I remember correctly it will push the ragnarock off but yggdrasil will also go away because a world card had been present that turn. If thats right you could use grave dirt to push off ragnarok and then add the spiny seed.

Its important that yggdrasil comes after the EGC otherwise you can only get to +15s.

Nope! At the time you add the Spiny Seed, you have (Pixie)Card/Card/Ragnarok.
Since there's a World Card present when you add the Yggdrasil, you're going to end up with (---)EvilGod/Card/Card, and no Yggdrasil.

Ragnarok's effect on Pixies is permanent - once converted, they remain Evil God Cards.

In addition, you can use Sacrificed Nymph to manipulate where the Evil God Cards go. Whenever an Evil God Card is leaving your item, and there is a Sacrificed Nymph present, then the Sacrificed Nymph will leave instead of the Evil God Card, and the Evil God Card will be moved to where the Sacrificed Nymph was.

For example, (Sac.Nymph)Wisp/Shade/Leviathan. You add a Sala Silver.
You'll end up with (Sala)Leviathan/Wisp/Shade.

what is varnishing?
---
Winnipeg, is a "party city" with over 130 festival days a year 
From: Vilurum | Posted: 6/7/2003 11:51:36 PM | Message Detail 
Each weapon and material has four stats - sharp, heavy, force, and tech. Element levels notwithstanding, a weapon's attack power is WS*MS/128 + WH*MH/128 + WF*MF/128 + WT*MT/128.

Generally, you initially pick a material which works well with your weapon type - for example, if a weapon is a spear (52 sharp, 20 heavy), your material hopefully has better sharp than heavy - that way, you can accentuate the difference for better attack power (the low heavy won't hurt you as much since the weapon type doesn't use it as much; the high sharp will help you more since the weapon type makes more use of it).

Varnishing involves making use of your three visible Mystic Cards, as well as your most recently tempered item, to provide a cumulative +50%/-50% effect to two stats. Each of the (applicable) cards/items will increase one stat by 50% and decrease another by 50%. So you increase the stat which you're already emphasizing (sharp, in my example above), and decrease the stat which hopefully wasn't playing too much of a role to begin with.

Even if the decreased stat was playing something of a role (this will happen with balanced weapons like swords - especially on balanced materials like metals), you end up with a bigger absolute difference for the result. Four cumulative effects to the two stats (three cards, one item) will result in the increased stat being multiplied by 5.0625, and the decreased stat being divided by 16 (multiplied by 0.0625).

Say they were both 32 to begin with. The increased one would end up at 162 (gain of 130). The decreased would end up at 2 (loss of 30).

So even in the worst case - balanced weapon, balanced material - you still come out ahead. In a better case (emphasizing strengths - say, by having a high-sharp weapon type made of a high-sharp material, with sharp being the stat emphasized by your varnish), it's much more of an advantage.

Anyway, the three main varnishes are:

3x Clown card w/ Sharp Claw (+ to sharp, - to heavy)
3x Cleric card w/ Giant's Horn (+ to heavy, - to sharp)
3x Volcano card w/ Scissors (+ to force, - to tech)

There is no card which provides +50% tech (-50% force), however, so there's no varnish to emphasize tech. The item Poison Fang does give that boost, but there are no cards to go with it so you'd only have the effect once, rather than four times cumulatively. You end up better off by using one of the other varnishes, even on a high-tech weapon (like the glove).

rite? so the pixie pushes out the Ragnork card and becomes an evil god then the last card item would push in yggdracil and push out the EGC but the Sac. Nymph would take its place and i would end up with
(Card)Yggdracil/EGC/Aura
then if i keep adding cardless items i would get a +1/-1/+1 to luck (the only stat i really care about boosting) to eventually get 20+ luck rite?
thx for you time!

Using evil god cards and yddrasil is the most effective. And I think its well worth 2 spiny seeds to get +20 to all your stats.
But maybe a slightly easier method is to use an aura coin and a bumpkin to get an aura and clown card visible. Then just add cardless items (like meats) and you can get +9 to luck for as long as the clown card stays visible.

Fertility Goddess will *only* give the Exp Share ability to Rings.

Phoenix, however, *will* give its own ability to both Rings and Pendants if both Phoenix and Volcano are in one of the visible slots, and neither are in the Hidden Slot. However, unlike most other special effects, Phoenix's revive special will *VANISH* if either Phoenix is not in *any* Visible slot or there is a Phoenix in the Hidden Slot.

I don't see why you can't add Yggdrasil in...

Assuming its non-wood.

If its due to the Ragnarok, then just putting cards in till its gone, use a Ghost Howl to put a sacrificial nymph in to move Evil God back to top slot, then add yggdrasil via spiny seed. Push in Yggdrasil with your first Varnish card, add Toadstoolsheds till 20+ stats, add another card to get the varnish card, then cap it with appropriate item.

So if you had something like

Evil God
Card
Ragnarok

add

1x Card
1x Ghost Howl
1x Spiny Seed

Current Card will look
(Yggdrasil)
Sacrificed Nymph
Card
Evil God

then add

1x Varnish Card Item

and you'll have

(Clown/Cleric/Volcano)
Yggdrasil
Evil God
Card

#x Toadstoolsheds (however many you need)
1x Card
1x Capper

End result will be

(Card)
Clown/Cleric/Volcano
Yggdrasil
Evil God

They are one of two items that adds [+1] to all of your stat bonuses.
The other item is Dragon Blood, which creates a Card if Salamander > 2. So, Toadstoolshed is the only cardless item that raises your stats by [+1].

With Yggdrasil and an Evil God present, your Limitations can go up to +20, and your current 'overall bonus' is 0 (+1 Yggdrasil, -1 Evil God). Adding Toadstoolsheds makes your 'overall bonus' to be [+1], allowing you to add about 10 or so Toadstoolsheds to get +20 all, EVEN when you have Salamander present more than 2.

Where can I find:
-a chart of growth control
-The formulas with the essences, growth control and etc. that allows us to get weapon's potential powers?
-a chart of essence resistance and energy needed to go up a level in that essence that goes up to 15(the only one available goes up to 9)

Where can I find:
-a chart of growth control

Go to Myst's site in his Sig, under Files, the .txt marked Materials

-The formulas with the essences, growth control and etc. that allows us to get weapon's potential powers?

((Total Essences + Growth Control)/ Growth Control) X Material Stat X Weapon Stat) / 128)

Whenever you add something that say increases Sharp by 50%, Multiply Material Stat by 1.5 and take Integer Value. Repeat as necessary.

Add Slash + Heavy + Force + Tech (including all decimals) and you'll get the Final Attack Value (integer)

-a chart of essence resistance and energy needed to go up a level in that essence that goes up to 15(the only one available goes up to 9)


Don't feel like writing a chart... but

Element Resistance X 2^Element Level

Low Resistances like 6 and 7
1x Wizard Card Resistance is 4
2-3x Wizard Card Resistance is 1

High Resistances Like 8, 9, 10
1x Wizard Card Resistance is 6
2x Resistance is 4
3x Resistance is 1

So if I want to see how much energy it would take to get Salamander on AltenaAlloy from 9 => 10 with 1x Wizard card

6*2^9 = 3072 Needed Energy

((Total Essences + Growth Control)/ Growth Control) X Material Stat X Weapon Stat) / 128)

To be fair, the '/ 128' part doesn't happen until we've totalled up the results from all four stats. LoM doesn't work in floating point division; the only reason we divide by 128 first is to make the different numbers easier for *us* to handle and compare.

(For the record, the results of the different stats aren't held on the item at all; LoM just works out the base offense from all of them, and then just dumps the result on the item. Outside of the workshop, LoM doesn't care a thing about tempering, and just relies on everything that's been saved on the item itself. Amusingly, this includes its item cost, which is something that's only worked out when you leave the workshop...)

Sorry, i don't mean to interrupt any conversations or discussions but the Revive effect (Phoenix/Volcano) doesn't seem to work on my pendant. I believe Terence said that it also works on pendants. 
411- 
My pendant is made of Adamantite
All essence markers/defence
All Immunities
+10 on all stats
Level 5 on Wisp, Shade, Dryad, Aura, Salamander, Jinn
Level 4 on Undine and Gnome
Mystic Cards are as follows

(Spirit of the Forest [Moth Wing])
Phoenix
Volcano
Yggdracil

Now, from past experience, i don't think the material would affect it but maybe the essence levels? 

PS. Yes, i'm obsessed with the Revive effect. I mean its so cool, no other games have this....ok maybe very few, (off the top of my head i can think of the Final attack+Phoenix/Revive combo)

I think Terence was wrong(if it's actually him that said that), I remember someone saying the effect only works on rings 2 or 3 pages before. Unless it was in another topic. I think the FAQs also mention it working only in rings.

As for the coolness, I'm not here to argue, but it gets costly to always add phoenix cards over and over again and it's pretty hard to die when you're good, even in No Future...

aww....that sucks, all the good effects are only avaliable on Rings. Pendants are much better cuase 1) all immunites and 2) higher defence...o well....

On another note, how rare a spiny seeds? are they the rarest drops on some plant enemies? and where is the easiest place to get them? I've been on the loun highway for like half-an-hour and i only got 4 spiny seeds (i run back and forth on the screen between the two forks, three lullabuds, two stingers bugs, 1 Denden) but i have like 97 clear feathers!!!!no joke!!! O yea, i also played the shadow zero mini game but i was only able to get 1 seed cuase its so flippin' hard getting 200 points...

THe reason i want spiny seeds is that i decided to raise a good polter-box and succubus and they need lots of applesocks and rocket papayas.

It most certainly *does* work in Pendants. I've tested it myself. And there is also no reason why it shouldn't work if you have Volcano and Phoenix in the visible slots and there isn't a hidden Volcano or Phoenix in the Hidden Slot.

All I can suggest is that you try again, and if it still doesn't work, make an amulet from scratch to test it for yourself. I made a simple one from MenosBronze with the following recipe: Firestone, Sala Silver, Windstone, Jinn Silver, Ash, Flaming Quill, Lilipods.

That's funny. I've got a Polter Box with the following stats, and all I used was 198 Cabbadillos, 23 Orcaplants, and 49 Gold Clovers. No applesocks or Rocket Papayas for me, even though I've got plenty of those Spiny Seeds. It seems like a waste to plant them...

Anyway, the stats for my Polter Box are as follows:

99/99/03/99

59 99/99/99/03

2-3x Wizard Card Resistance is 1

High Resistances Like 8, 9, 10
1x Wizard Card Resistance is 6
2x Resistance is 4
3x Resistance is 1

This is wrong.
The resistances go as follows:
#of wizards: 0/1/2/3 =
5 /3 /1 /1
6 /3 /1 /1
7 /3 /1 /1
8 /6 /3 /1
9 /6 /3 /1
10 /6 /3 /1
11 /6 /3 /1
12 /9 /6 /3
13 /9 /6 /3
...
32 /24 /18 /16

The formula for Resistance With Wizard is:
[ Old Resistance / 4 ] * 3

(where the square brackets means 'integer division')

On a minor note: Revive works on Pendants, but Share Experience does not. Perhaps that's what got you confused?

Excluding Pixies (which are valued at a mere 150 Lucre), the next-cheapest Mystic Cards are Essense Cards, all of which are 250 Lucre a pop.
Some miscellaneous Cards (Raven, Wolf, Witch, Cleric, Sorcerer, Witch) are the next-cheapest, running in at 300 Lucre each.
There's a big leap after that, to 800 Lucre for any of the Spirit Cards.
Then there's the Nobles and Maiden Cards, ringing in a sound 1000 Lucre each.
Volcano and Tower are at 1300 Lucre each, while Spring, Bed of Thorn, and Metropolis are 1500 Lucre each.
Also at 1500 Lucre each are the royal King and Princess Cards.
Heaven's Scale is a delightful 1800 Lucre.
The consumption-affect cards, Ancient Moon and Mirrored World, come to a rather expensive 2200 Lucre.
The Beast Cards, Unicorn and Phoenix, are worth 2500 Lucre, which is a little less than the 2600 Lucre obtained from the Dying Earth Card, oddly enough.
Blacksmith God, at 2800, is just below the plethora of Cards worth 3000 Lucre, including Yggdrasil, Sun God, Moon Goddess, Goddess of Love, Fertility Goddess, Ocean God, Wind God, Wisdom Goddess, and God of War.
Mother of Gods and Thunder God surpass all of those with a rather astute 4000 Lucre each, with the Ruler of Sky topping them all with 5000 Lucre.
All of the Evil God Cards are worth a fitting 6660 Lucre, and, finally, the end of the world card, Ragnarok, is worth a whopping 10000 Lucre.

Ok i found the secret to the revive effect
The effect will only occur if you are the "last man standing". I tested this all afternoon. If i died before my pet then the battle would continue but my bar would slowing refill; i would not be instant revived. But if i died after my pet than the effect would take place, i would be restored to 100% hp and the Phoenix card leaves. 
This is probably not new to you guy but i though i share what i found as nobody told me this fact about the effect....
PS. the effect does work on pendants, my bad

A theory about Mirrored World. I know it will seem strange, but I'm almost 100% sure that Mirrored world card releases energy went it leaves your piece of equipment.

I noticed this while trying the great Ultimate Diorwood tempering. It was on step V

V 14-15-14-15-0-13-0-14
Needle
Mirror piece
4x Earthstone
Waterstone
...

My diorbow gained 3-4 attack points per essence level gained and when I added the Earthstone(pushing the Mirrored world card out) My bow's power went from 303 to 317. This step doesn't raise Dryad by a single level so the Dryad TP has nothing to do here. Sala was already at level 0 so he isn't drained by the Waterstone either. But as the mirrored world card left, there were 4 active TPs, Gnome TPs, allowing 4 levels to be gained at once in Gnome. Also, No levels were gained as I added the other 3 Earthstones, removing the "Almost Impossible Possibility" that Earthstone could've caused that energy surge(from lv 9 to 13).

I even had to confirm my theory so I retried, with a 1H sword(I had another save with everything required to make this ultimate formula) What do I see? Step H has a similar effect.

H 1-1-13-12-2-0-0-10
mirror piece
aura silver
2x mercury
firestone
2x any seed
mirror piece
any seed
2x sulpher
firestone

Each time a Mirrored World card left here, my sword gained about 10 attack points. Note that it left both times when a firestone was pushed in. Since sala is only 2, those TPs did nothing else but raise sala once, but each time, either Dryad or Aura had a TP. This step also offers us something more, it raises Dryad from 10 to 13 and Aura from 11 to 12. It may be a less good proof since Undine is drained each time a firestone is added, but I do believe it has some sort of effect too.

Unless Bed of Thorns needs to leave before mirrored world for it to have the "energy discharge" effect, hmmm... Unless someone can explain me something I didn't see...

If more testing is required, I still have that save to make the weapon again(tip, never be disturbed while doing this formula, I lost my sword on step "I" because I was distracted...)

*SIDE NOTE* The formula really works, There's nothing wrong in it.

Mirrored World does not release any energy upon leaving the item.

The reason why you're getting such an energy increase is because of the following. Let's look at it while we have 1/ 1/10/11/ 0/ 0/ 0/12 on the item, where we've just done Mirror Piece, Aura Silver and 2 Mercury, and are about to add in a Firestone.

First off, Firestones have 24 Energy. Mirrored World is on the card before Card Movement, and it is in Slot 3, so it is most certainly Active.

First, we deal with Dryad, since this is Wood. Wisp is equal to Shade, so there's no Conflict. Because of this, there's also no Aura Consumption. We have greater than or equal to 8 energy at the moment, so we're allowed to raise Dryad... just not yet. The game makes note to try and raise Dryad one level at the end of the temper phase. And we add a Dryad Card, ready to be pushed in.

Now the Firestone. No conflict under Mirrored World; there's no Gnome. However, there is Undine... so we're going to consume it. Diorwood has 7 Undine Resistance and the current level is 12... so we drop Undine to L11 and release 14336 energy. That gives us 14360 total. Oh, and we make a note to try and raise Sala one level at the end of the temper phase. And we add a Salamander Card, which overwrites Dryad, and is ready to be pushed in.

CARD MOVEMENT: Off goes Mirrored World, but it's still the active World Card. In goes Salamander Card into the Hidden slot.

Mirrored World got pushed off, and it has no extra effect.

The Aura card next. We try to increase Luck by one point, and then we try and do an Aura Taint. There's no conflict (Wisp = Shade), and no consumption (same reason), but we've got more than 8 energy, so we'll... well... make a note to raise Aura a level if we can at the end of the temper phase.

Witch #1 reduces the resistances of Shade, Aura, Jinn and Undine to 6, 6, 3 and 3 respectively. Witch #2 reduces them to 3, 3, 1 and 1 respectively.

End of temper phase. We have 14360 energy, and we've made a note to raise Dryad, Aura and Shade, which must be done in that order. Dryad's Resist is 5, Aura's Resist is 3, Sala's Resist is 10.

That means we need: 5120 Energy for Dryad L11, 6144 Energy for Aura L12 and 10 Energy for Sala L1. That totals up to 11274 energy... we even have 3086 wasted energy to spare afterwards.

So, you see, it has nothing to do with Mirrored World leaving. The key was that we were triggering an Undine consumption *using* Mirrored World's properties. Mirrored World, alone, does not produce any extra energy for us to use. 
From: Infestedprobe | Posted: 6/27/2003 3:01:50 PM | Message Detail 
That still doesn't explain the first situation with the 4 earthstones since Gnome can't be draining Jinn(there is none present) and sala can't be drained by the waterstone(he's not there either) So where does THAT energy comes from then?

Also, If there is 3 gold coins on an item, does that makes 6 TPs(making it possible to raise the essence by 6 levels at once!?) Just wondering for this one.

Look at the Earthstone setup. 14/15/14/15/ 0/ 9/ 0/13.

Remember. Wood has an automatic Dryad TP. So what does this do normally and under Mirrored World?

Normally, Shade is greater than Wisp and Aura is present. Dryad is thus in Conflict. It cannot rise, it cannot consume.

Under Mirrored World, however, Dryad is no longer in Conflict. And Shade is greater than Wisp. HELLO AURA CONSUMPTION.

Now, why does it wait until the Mirrored World leaves to happen? It's because of the Bed of Thorn. The active World Card is always the one nearest Slot 3. And for activated World Cards... Bed of Thorn counts as one. So, until the Bed of Thorn leaves, the Mirrored World isn't having any effect. But on the turn *after* the Bed of Thorn leaves, Mirrored World is active. And so Aura consumes, and the 4 Gnome TPs and 1 Dryad TP take advantage of it. (And the Waterstone is just to set up an Undine TP to take advantage of the Aura Taint and Consumption the Garlicrown will cause in a few more moves)

---

Oh, and Gold Coins do *not* have two TPs. And they're an item, anyway, not a card, so they only apply once for the current turn. If you've tempered in four gold coins in a row (and nothing untoward is happening like cards not being pushed in due to energy requirements and the like), you'll have 3 TPs from the cards on the item, and 1 TP from the coin itself. The maximum number of TPs you can have for one essense is 5, and that's Dryad (since Woods have an automatic Dryad TP)

Strange, I DO have 7 sala on my bow... There's one place it was supposed to go up but it didn't like I expected(some tempering chains were repeated all over the formula so I almost knew by heart when essences raised) but still the last part made it go up to 7.

Thanks to your last explanation, I finally understood why he was always putting the chain "Needle, Mirror piece" It was to delay Mirrored World's effect while still being there. What I don't get is what are Garlicrowns doing exactly? He used them last in about half of his steps but I didn't get it. Sometimes they raised an essence, sometimes not.

Garlicrowns have an Aura TP, but don't create a troublesome Aura card.

And everytime I work through it, it always breaks at the same spot: 15/15/14/14/ 5/15/ 9/15 on the item and the place where you add 3x Mercury after placing a Chaos Crystal on the item... which... makes no sense because the only thing left to raise is Sala, and you're at the stage where you can't consume *ANYTHING*. The Firestone after the 3 Witches doesn't work (with 3x Sorcerer, it would; you're putting in 48 Energy and you only need 32 to get from Sala 5 to Sala 6 with 3 Sorcs), and that's the turn Ancient Moon leaves so you can't do any raising *after* that until you add another Chaos Crystal. And when you get to the *VERY* final step, you only have one Sorc up, and you need two to get Sala to 7 (it's 384 energy required with 1, and 192 with 2, so the Nymph of Dawn *would* work... if you had two....)

It's a case of: I can see that it's possible... but not the way the recipe says it is. At least as I understand it.

Maybe the firestone reacts differently if there's some other card present. That would explain with mostly mana stones are used in the formula. 

Other then that I see your point, though I swear I have sala = 7 on my 999 Diorbow and that at the exact moment of adding the firestone sala raised a level(the base power went from 378 to 381 exactly) so it HAS to work somehow.

Sulphur
Mercury
2x waterstone
2x mercury
Garlicrown
Sun crystal

Shouldn't it be Mercury x2 instead of Sulphur/Mercury because from what i can tell, your raising only undine (wisp later on). I didn't see a comsumption either execpt for the possible Dyrad comsumption when the garlicrown was added in but before wisp was raised(so Shade>Wisp)

I tested this and put two mercuries and i got the result 2-2-12-13-0-0-0-14 

Can anyone help? i think it might be me who misunderstood cause i'm not that good at tempering in the first place and nobody else saw this....

That's not a mistake... simply a different choice.

The key part occurs when you add the 2nd Waterstone. At that point, Mirrored World has just left the card, and it's finally active since Bed of Thorn left before it. 

Remember. Woods have an *INHERENT* Dryad TP. Shade's greater than Wisp... so we have an Aura consumption, and Dryad is trying to raise.

The Waterstone gives us 24 Energy plus an Undine TP. There's another Undine TP on the Undine card, too. There's no Conflict nor Consumptions available there though.

Now, we could do it with two Mercury... or we could go the way the recipe says and use a Sulpher and a Mercury. Let's try it with both.

In either case, Dryad takes priority over Undine when it comes to essense raises. Aura just got consumed, and the consumption happened before the Sorcerer and the Witch was looked at, so we're given an extra 36864 energy.

Dryad needs 20480/12288/4096/4096 energy to get from L12 to L13, depending on the number of Sorcerer cards. Undine needs 43008/18432/6144/6144 energy to get from L11 to L13, depending on the number of Witch cards. We have 36888 energy total.

Obviously, we need at least *one* Witch, otherwise we can kiss goodbye to what we're trying to do here. At one Witch card only, we have 18432 energy required for Undine and 20480 energy required for Dryad. This is still too much; we'd get to L13 Dryad and L12 Undine, but not L13 Undine. So we need to decrease the energy more.

With two Witches, we'd have 20480 + 6144 energy required = 26624 energy. Plenty. *Or*, we could use a Witch and a Sorcerer, giving us a requirement of 30720 energy for all three levels. Still within the range.

So, as we can see, it's not a mistake. Simply a choice.

Just noticed something about the AdamPendant Immune All 20+ recipe and not sure if its been mentioned yet.

Very minor, but just noticed that Creepy Eye and Moth Wing does not do the same thing to Magic D.

Creepy Eye will increase Magic D by 25%
Moth Wing will increase Magic D by 50% (while still reducing all others, but hey its a pendant)

Also verified it from Terence's Subroutine file

Tempering Newb here with a couple quick questions:

On armors, do element levels get you anything? 

Or should I just temper enough to get my resistance flags/requirements for cards?

Secondly: Do resistances stack? Is having 3 dryad resist equips better than one?

Thanks so much, you will be saving me mucho time if and when you answer. n.n

From what I've heard they don't stack, and they only prevent ~10% of the damage.

Chronofreak,

You're laziness is deplorable. But the way that you nonchalantly request help, when help is already abundantly available is equally despicable...

"Oh, and by the way, could you also include EVERYTHING (+ secrets of the universe) because I am a mook with no hope of completing a single cognitive thought. 7|-|@|\|X111"

My best advice to you is this: Do it yourself!

Between Marcus Majarra's Guide and the LoM Kitchen, it will take you less than a whole week to figure most of the basics out for yourself. Instead, you're asking for someone to just casually take (at least) a few hours out of their day to lay out the intricacies of a few things that are easily attainable through a little reading combined with some trial and error. It's a game, right. Why not use your own time playing it a little beforehand. And then if you still have questions, at least they'll be somewhat intelligent because you have a bit of knowledge about tempering in general to back them up.

Help yourself. You've certainly shown no reason for anyone else to do so...

Maybe this comes across as harsh, but I don't think that it is anything of the sort. I spent almost a week of my personal leisure time figuring out tempering through the aforementioned methods to at least understand what's going on when I browse through a recipe. And this allowed me to write my own recipes, and I'm rather proud of this, too. I don't understand individuals that only want results. The game isn't played in the results. The game is played in the methods.

Bah! It's all lost on you. Just buy a GameShark and be done with it.

Alright. A few questions I'd like answered.

1) For weapon/armor power, it doesn't matter which Essences you _have_, only that there are a lot of them? _All_ the Essences get totaled up and figured into a multiplier for the innate stats? And if so, is this before or after you apply things like the Clown/Claw or Cleric/Horn varnish?

2) Mirror Pieces, which produce the Mirrored World card, aren't _found_ on anything in the game, only in a few treasure chests? So you'd have to play through the game multiple times just to get all the mirror pieces needed for those ultimate recipies?

3) This is just an observation, not a question, but... my weapon, made back in the old-school days when 7 and 8 essence were considered tough to get, is a LorimarIron Spear, no varnishing, total attack power 227, essences 6 across the board. I think I one-shotted the Dark Mana Goddess with it using a Lo and Behold, on my first playthrough. For some reason, I can still kick ass with it, even in No Future mode. So a weapon with maybe 8's or 9's across the board, done with Chaos Crystals and wizard cards, and varnished properly, would still be a unilateral kicker of ass? The only purpose of taking essences to 14 or 15 is as an academic exercise?

Acedemic exercises are all well and good, but I a) like the combat system and b) don't like dying. If a simple temper will let me survive a battle with a little skill, the attraction and the desire aren't there for me to go whip up an UBERRECIPE.

Its generally a good idea to have each Essence Flag on a Weapon/Armor. The total number of Essences on Weapons will effect the Total Attack Power. The exact part in the formula is ((Total Essence * Growth Control)/Growth Control).

More Essences on Armor WILL NOT effect the Defense Power of the armor, generally its a good idea just to get the Essence Flags, and any other Essence Req. for certain cards you like to put on. But other than that, no real point in raising em. (Less you want to make a neat looking Golem thats appeasing to the eye stat wise, but don't really mean much).

2) Mirror Pieces, which produce the Mirrored World card, aren't _found_ on anything in the game, only in a few treasure chests? So you'd have to play through the game multiple times just to get all the mirror pieces needed for those ultimate recipies?

There are only 4 Mirror Pieces through one play through.

Locations:

Underworld
Madora Beach (In the lighthouse)
Mana Tree

I can't remember where the other one is, I really want to say Tower of Leires, but just not sure.

There is a work around playing the game through multiple times. Once you get access to Professor Bombs Trading Service. You can swap Weapons between Save files.

Have a total of 3 saves

1. Original Save
2. Temp Save
3. Friends Save **Must be a whole new game

Have all your materials on the original save, start tempering a weapon as much as you want. When you use up the materials. Go to Professor Bomb, and Pawn your weapon. Save on the Temp Save.

Load up Friends Save and purchase the Weapon from Prof. Bomb. Pawn it back to him and then Save on Temp Save.

Load up Original Save, go to Prof. Bomb and purchase the Weapon back. Start tempering again and repeat the process till you're finished.

Just make sure you never save over the Original Save and Friends Save.

3) This is just an observation, not a question, but... my weapon, made back in the old-school days when 7 and 8 essence were considered tough to get, is a LorimarIron Spear, no varnishing, total attack power 227, essences 6 across the board.

Okay, let me see if I've got the general idea behind the process of tempering...

1) You add an item to the object you're tempering. This gives it some amount of energy.

2) If the object produces a card, that card goes into the "invisible slot" - or a card of the appropriate essence on a sensitive item. Other cards are shoved down and possibly kicked out.

3) Starting from the bottom card, the earliest card added, the energy works its way up, adding potential gains to the list of TPs, procing various card effects like transmuting pixies and kicking off Nymphs of Dawn, boosting Shade and Wisp essences, until it's run the code for every card, including the top slot.

4) With whatever energy remains, elemental essences try to increase, in the order they were added to the list of TPs. An innate essence will come before? after? these TPs. 

5) Wait for another item to be added.

Is that about the right order? Totally wrong?

If people are still working on the FAQ using the actual master code that got pulled out of the game, let me know. I can't wait to see that...

Man, I remember when 6 was considered a tough essence to get. Those were the days.

Ok, basically you'll replace the last bed of thorns with a card that adds another effect.
Your first option is heavens scale which will allow you the regen hp even when moving, but if you die you'll stay dead. Just replace the last needle with a springanana (yellow produce).
The other option is to add a goddess of love which will make enemies drop more lucre. It needs some essenses (3+ shade, 3+ dryad) then add the two needles, a virgin's sigh, and the moth wing.

I have two questions. I read through MarcusMajarra's Tempering FAQ and understand the basics of tempering, and I want to make a powerful 1H Sword. Can somebody tell me:

1) What is the best material for a 1H Sword? I was thinking about using DiorWood, but is there anything more suitable?

2)For the varnishing process, most weapons achieve the best results when raising a strong attribute on the weapon while lowering a weak attribute on the weapon. For a 1H Sword, Slash, Heavy, Thrust, and Tech are all the same. What is the best method for varnishing in this situation? 
From: Myst Erik Ery | Posted: 7/6/2003 5:23:54 PM | Message Detail 
For varnishing swords, you have to varnish according to the material's properties.

For the record, DiorWood makes the most powerful swords. Actually, DiorWood makes the most powerful everything except for Staves, Gloves, and Flails (which Dragonscales does better with). Oh, and Hammers, but they can reach 999 either way.

:) The best varnish for Swords on DiorWood is 3x Clown, 1 Sharp Claw.

Right, but there also the material. Most non metal materials have varied attributes. So just go with the highest of those.
BUT!!!
After multiplying by all those 1.5s the material attribute is capped at ~255. So even though diorwood has a better force than sharp they both only goto 255...
255+1+70+20 > 50+30+255+1

And if you're making a metal sword I'd go with sharp since clowns can support +9s to stats. 
From: Glazius | Posted: 7/7/2003 9:08:08 PM | Message Detail 
Okay, maybe you can help me out here, since I haven't got a clue why this didn't work.

I'm playing a Valkyrie-type character (with a DragonScale spear with a Gungnir plunge called Valesti) and for effect, I wanted as the Beast God card on my ScaleArmor the Fallen Angel. I also wanted Metropolis, so I needed a little Shade, but I wanted to put Fallen Angel directly in with an Angel Feather, so I needed to use up the Shade.

I came up with the following ingenious configuration. Dryad was at about 5 or 6 to put in Yggdrasil later, and the slots on the armor looked like this - 

(Metropolis)
Sorceror
Sorceror
Sorceror

I then began adding Angel Feathers, cardless Wisp taints. But no matter how many I tacked on Wisp wouldn't rise above 3.

I've since tried to duplicate this, and it seems that with armor or any sort with 3 Wisp essence, and the setup

(Metropolis)
Sorceror
Sorceror
Sorceror

I can't get another Wisp essence to show up, even though with 3 wizard cards 32 energy should be enough. (I tried tossing in Witches too, just in case I'd forgotten which it was. Still no go.)

Are the phases of the moon aligned against me here, or is there some code I haven't considered yet?

--GF 
From: Terence | Posted: 7/7/2003 9:22:25 PM | Message Detail 
Wisp and Shade Taints only take notice of Sorcerer and Witch if they happen *after* the occurence of the Wizard card. So you can't use three Sorcs. You should instead use:

[Metropolis]
Wisp
Sorcerer
Sorcerer

...and then temper in your cardless items. You don't even need to use Angel Feathers this way; Bellgrapes, Mangolephants and Gold Clovers will work too, offering even more energy and allowing you to cardless temper up to 7, should you really be bothered to (although on an armor, there's not much point). Besides, with DragonScales, you only need two Sorcs anyway to get its Wisp Resistance down to 1.

Hey, thanks. Would not have worked that out on my own. I guess the stuff with innate Wisp/Shade taints isn't as useful as I thought...

Cardless tempering is great, though. I remember back when I needed like 30k to get all the chaos and glow crystals needed to get just _6_ essences on everything, and now I can go 7/5 on Dragonscales and 5/4 on everything else without breaking a sweat.

The right varnish and I'm looking at 300-400 attack power, way more than my old RimarSpear...

Dear gaijin,

I'm sorry if that was what it seemed. I happen to have been playing for a while already, but I do not understand the system behind the extra plunge attacks. I didn't mean to sound arrogant, but rather I was trying to sound formal. I don't need the details exactly here. Links to sites with info would be fine. I was just requesting for the info. I don't have as much time as to go through the game several times to solve a mystery. This board is, in a way, meant to help save time from doing such relentless acts, I would assume. By the by, I did state that I was requesting for help, and not commanding anyone to help.

I do not, however, appreciate your exaggeration and offensive comment. I had to put up a message during the little time I had before I would be late to class (Yes, I am a bording student.). If you don't want to help because I sound rude then don't, but don't make a big deal of something small. It's not necessary and also unwanted. Besides that, it is also a waste of time for yourself. If you were to comment on my syntax, then please mind yourown as well (for you did offend me - intentionally I would assume - in your reply).

In any case, I apologize for any offense I might have done. It wasn't intentional. However, I hope that someone that judges others for their rudeness might refrain from doing so themselves.

Thank you for the resources.

They say the best way to learn something is to do it, and certainly following the uberrecipe all the way to the end actually _in_ the game has given me an appreciation for cardless taints, the Aura/Dryad/Mirrored World MASSIVE ENGINE OF ESSENCE LEVEL CREATION, and an understanding of exactly how released energy affects other essence levels.

I'm a little confused by this part of the recipe, though. 

mirror piece
2x firestone
sulpher
any seed
sun crystal (leading to)
G 1-1-9-10-11-0-0-0
any seed
mercury
spiny carrot
chaos crystal
moon crystal (leading to)
H 1-2-11-10-10-0-0-1
2x mercury

And others like it. I can understand why the Sun God and Moon Goddess cards aren't showing up - not enough essence. But the chaos crystal, though it pushed the Witch out onto the item, never seemed to actually create an Ancient Moon, even though there was obviously _some_ sort of Ancient Moon-like effect that let Shade go up with Wisp present.

So, uh, what the heck happened? 

--GF 
From: Terence | Posted: 7/10/2003 5:46:24 PM | Message Detail 
Remember how World Cards delete themselves if another World Card is already active on the item? That's what happened here. The Ancient Moon was created, but you tempered in what was essentially a cardless item. So the Ancient Moon stayed a turn in the Hidden slot. Since it was the only World Card on the item, it was automatically considered to be the active one. And if it detects an active one, even if it's itself, it will delete itself if it's still in the Hidden slot.

So IOW, you got the Ancient Moon effect for one turn, and then the card was deleted because it was still in the Hidden slot.

Nice trick. You could probably set up something like this to get yourself pretty high..

(Ancient Moon)
Shade
Witch

and then just keep tempering in cardless items and re-adding the Chaos Crystal.

Of course, raising Shade first is usually the best way to go, but I can understand why they wanted to keep the balance shifting in order for Aura/Dryad to turn into a pseudo-perpetual-motion-machine...

You also need to use 2 Sulphers on the last two steps, not one. Those are the only mistakes in the Ultimate DiorWood recipe.

And what makes you think Bed of Thorn prevents the Dryad TP on Woods at all?

oh oh

*runs into bomb shelter*

Keep in mind I've never actually USED the Ultimate Diorwood to make a weapon. But have looked it over enough to get the basic jist of it.

*attempts to answer*

The reason Bed of Thorns doesn't cause Aura to drain out while Mirror World is on the weapon is because... Bed of Thorns is the Active World Card! *remembers the pixie incident*

So do I get a Cookie or the Dunce hat?

Cookie :P It's fairly easy to see that Bed of Thorn alone doesn't stop the Dryad TP; temper in 1 Glow Crystal, a Needlettuce, followed by 3 Glow Crystals into a new piece of Wood equipment to see.

I used:
4x glow crystal
2x sulpher

it worked fine. :)

Doh!!!
Bed of Thorns is just having itself as the active world effect to cover up mirrored world, not disrupting the TP.

DarkHoly:

I don't know what to say. I doubt anyone knows quite what to say. I don't think anyone knows what it is that your weapon needs. I think most of us here are afraid to accept responsibility for the consequences if you try to use the following recipie:

Flat seed x 1
Glow Crystal x 3
Needle x 1
Pine O clock x 1
Spiny seed x 2
Rust x 1
...ummm

You know, I don't even know how you'd finish a + 20 stat recipe on wood. But I wouldn't let items with names like "Needle" and "Spiny seed", or "Rust" any where near any of my wood items, much less be hammering them in.

And since legend of mana is an action game, in the end:
It ain't the size of the attack bonus, but how it is used that counts.

Flat seed x 1
Glow Crystal x 3
Needle x 1
Pine O clock x 1
Spiny seed x 2
Rust x 1

For Needle to create Bed of Thorns, Sala == 0.

So Pine O Clock can create Ragnarok, Sala/Gnome/Jinn/Undine has to be at least 1 essence level.

With this card order

Evil God
Yggdrasil
Yggdrasil

You'd only get +15 to all

You'd have to do

Yggdrasil
Evil God (most likely Leviathan)
Yggdrasil

Instead.

Okay: I guess I only knew one thing for sure: I didn't know what I was doing.

But, considering the post I'm responding to (2 pages back, last post, darkholynova) it won't matter. In any case, rather than give out faulty advice to people making bad jokes, I'll ask a newbish question... that you actually addressed without my anticipating!

"With this card order
Evil God
Yggdrasil
Yggdrasil

Yggdrasil
Evil God (most likely Leviathan)
Yggdrasil"

I just spent a half hour trying to make a +20 item, and failing because of my card order. (And of course, I knew better than to use pine'o clocks. I wonder how I let that slip by in my post...sigh. Guess I really am a newb.) I come back here, and my question is answered before I asked it. I had written down a "Quick +20 all" recipe that had been posted, and lost it, but remembered the general gist of it(i.e. using 2 ygdrasils to counter the continual -1 that tempering with an evil god gets you.), and tried to duplicate the results. Of course, with God - Yg - Yg as my card order, it flopped immensely. 

So I guess my question is this: Why is this the case? How does the card order affect stat pumpage?

Neither the god or Ygdrasil have +15 as an upper limit, so I must have been incorrect in my initial assumption that the bonuses are all added together and then added/subtracted as appropriate.

Thank you for your time...

Bonuses are applied in the order of the cards, from bottom to top.

Now, normally, it applies each bonus, and then, at the end, sets them to the Limitation IF they're above or below the Limitations.

However, because +20 is [15], and the highest value possible, any bonus that goes ABOVE [15] is automatically reset to [15] again, immediately. So, while +1/+1/-1 does indeed end up with a net gain of +1... depending on the order, one of those two +1's might be negated if the Bonus is already at +20 [15] when it should be added.

It's the same with -10 [0] - if you try to lower it below that, it will be set to [0] again, although that doesn't happen as often...

So, with Evil God / Yggdrasil / Yggdrasil, here's what happens:

You've got +15 [14]. Now, the bottom Yggdrasil adds one. You've got +20 [15]. Now, the next Yggdrasil adds one. Since you've gone beyond [15], it stays as [15]. Now, the Evil God subtracts one. So now you have +15 [14] again.

Since the Evil God's subtraction will always be the last thing done, you're always going to end up with +15 rather than +20.

However, with Yggdrasil / Evil God / Yggdrasil, here's what happens:

You've got +15 [14]. Now, the bottom Yggdrasil adds one. You've got +20 [15]. Now, the Evil God subtracts one. So now you have +15 [14] again. Now, the top Yggdrasil adds one. You've got +20 [15].

See? :)

In fact I do see. Thanks a ton.

The discrepancy in my thinking is that I thought that each stat's gain was tallied, and then at the end added on.

But since the stat's value is actually altered as it goes along, and since we are dealing with half of a byte (Just like those cursed essence levels), it cannot go over 15 (F, as it were) or else it would roll over to -5, and bump up it's partner stat by one rank.

So, to further compound this problem, I could do the following to pump stats?

Get the following cards on my weapon/Armor:

(invisible, irrelevant to this scenario. I think?)
Beast Headed God
Ygdrasil
----------

And then pump Toadstoolsheds (assuming I don't have to worry about shade going up) or Dragon blood (Assuming Salamander <= 1) onto it until satisfied.

I'm not a big fan of No HP regen, so this would work nicely to avoid using needlettuce? I'm gonna try it out right now. n.n

Dur....

I mean:

Ygdrasil
BeastHeaded God
-empty-

And that would even leave me the freedom to push in an ability giving card like Fertility goddess! Without taking a hit to my stats!

Yes.
In fact, if you like, you can go:

(Invisible)
Whatever
Yggdrasil
Evil God

or

(Invisible)
Evil God
Whatever
Yggdrasil

And it'll still work. So long as Yggdrasil comes after the Evil God, it'll work.

The two items you mention, Toadstoolshed and Dragon Blood, are the only items that raise all stats. Since Dragon Blood produnces a Card when Sala > 2, the rare-but-mostly-useless Toadstoolshed finally has a use -- obtaining +20 all on equipment that has maxed Salamander essense (for more armor, Dragon Blood can be used while still having the resistance granted by Sala, although some Armor requires Sala 3 to get this resistance...).

Remember one last thing, however... There is still no way to get +20 all on Woods that have any Sala. You can't use Toadstooldshed or Dragon Blood because they create Cards. The only items you can add to wood that are 'cardless' are World Cards when there's already a World Card on your equipment. Since no World-Card-producing items add to your stats, you're stuck with +9 all (with Clown).

Speaking of that, rather than wasting 15 Toadstoolsheds, try to pass on +9 bonuses from a Clown Card to when you add the Evil God Card and the Yggdrasil Card, so you only need six or so Toadstoolsheds. :)

I'm glad my bad joke has done something good. (Dzarrin learned about tempering evil gods with yggdrasil)

I have a question now, what does the mirror piece do when I shove it in My Wang? I know mirror pieces are rare (only 4 per game) and are constantly mentioned in great recipies.

oh, Mystic! hows the tarot going?

The mirror piece reverses the normal order of things as long as it's the active world card, which begins the turn after you temper it in and continues until the turn it leaves.

Shade always rises. Wisp will not rise with Shade present and will get totally consumed if Shade exceeds it. Dryad only rises if Shade is not less than Wisp, and will consume Aura if Shade is greater. Aura only rises if Wisp is not less than Shade, and consumes Dryad if Wisp is greater.

Salamander will not rise with Gnome present, and consumes Undine. Undine will not rise with Salamander present, and consumes Jinn. Jinn will not rise with Undine present, and consumes Gnome. Gnome will not rise with Jinn present, and consumes Salamander.

This is, roughly, the "opposite" of how essences work without a Mirrored World card as the active world card.
