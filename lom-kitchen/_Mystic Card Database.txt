 Mystic Card Database - Help
#############################

In the Mystic Card Database, there are a number of columns.
Here's what each column means.

CARD ID - This column has the Card's internal ID number.
          Mostly for those of you with a GameShark, this column is pretty
          much just to put the Mystic Cards in a reasonable order.

CARD GROUP - This is the Card Group that the Mystic Card belongs to.
             The only real things you have to worry about are "World",
             "Evil God", and "Pixie".  The rest of the Group names are
             just for sorting purposes.

CARD NAME - This is the title of the Card as shown in the game.

PRICE - This is how much Lucre will be added to the price of your item.
        The cost of an item is equal to the four Mystic Cards it has, plus
        the cost of the base item.

LIMITATIONS - These are used to determine how high a Stat Bonus can go.  For
              example, if you had -3~+5, you could only raise each stat to
              a maximum of +5, but not more.  The Limitations used are always
              the most extreme ones for each stat.  Therefore, if you have an
              Evil God Card on your item, all stat values are possible, since
              then you can go from -10~+20.

BONUS (LIMITATIONS) - This section is divided into two different kinds of
                      bonuses.  First, you have Bonus Limitations (denoted by
                      the word 'lim') and ordinary Bonuses.

      BONUS LIMITATIONS (lim +5 Magic)
      These are almost like Limitations, but are slightly
      different.  If a stat falls within the Mystic Card's
      Limitations, but is below the Bonus Limitation of that Card,
      then that stat is set up to the Bonus Limitation.  Think
      of it as a special minimum value for one stat.

      BONUS (+1 Magic)
      These are how much a stat will raise each Tempering Phase.  As an
      example, take the Yggdrasil Card.  Every time you add something, and
      the Yggdrasil Card remains on your item, you'll get [+1] to all of
      your stats.  Likewise, the Dying Earth Card will lower your stats.

WEAPON/ARMOR EFFECTS - These are the effects your Mystic Card has on weapons and
                       armors.  A "W" denotes a Weapon effect, and an "A"
                       denotes an Armor effect.  A specific Weapon or Armor can
                       also be specified, like "Hammer:".  Anything that's in
                       quotation marks is a Plunge Attack, and status conditions
                       stand for an Immunity to that status.

SPECIAL EFFECTS - Sometimes, a Mystic Card will have a special effect.  This
                  is where that effect is listed.  Some special effects are
                  called Effects, and they have a special number.  You may only
                  have one such Effect at a time.  An example of an Effect is
                  the Bed of Thorn Effect, which prevents HP Recovery in battle.
                  Its Effect number is 1.  All Effects stay until replaced by
                  a new effect, except for the Revive Effect (2).  This Effect
                  will be lost if there isn't a Phoenix Card in one of the three
                  visible slots.

ITEM/ESSENCE REQUIREMENT - In this section, you will learn what items you'll use
                           to create each Mystic Card, and also any Essence
                           requirements.  "Total" means, of course, the added
                           sum of all Essence Levels.
