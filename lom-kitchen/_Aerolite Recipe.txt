Aerolite "Uber" Recipe

Typed/Tested: Locarte

Special Thanks to:

Terence for showing us that Salamander being constantly drained is a GOOD 
thing.  Also made the first good Aerolite Weapon (as far as I know anyway)

Myst Erik Ery for being a vocal authority of the tempering processes so that
all others could learn.

---------------------------------------------

Aerolites and what you need to know...

Rule #1: With each item you temper in, Salamander WILL DRAIN by 1 point.  Learn
 to live with it and love it.

Rule #2: Salamander can NEVER be put in a "Locked" status.  It is ALWAYS being
 drained whether it looks like it is or not

Rule #3: Review Rule #1 and #2.  There lies in the advantage.

Rule #4: Its recommended that you put in any Plunge Attacks BEFORE you start
 the recipe.  There is a good chance you won't get the oppertunity to add it in
 during the actual recipe.

---------------------------------------------

Notation: This recipe, I'm using the NemesisRock 2H Axe, Sweet Revenge dropped
 by Level 64+ Goblins
All Attack Power Values and Pre Temper Recipe reflect that.

Pre Recipe Temper:

Earth Stone
Sulpher
2x Flaming Quill
Glow Crystal
Giant Horn (for Treefeller Plunge)


[[ This section by Myst:

If you're forging it raw, you'll need to do this:
4 Any Meat (to clear away the four starting Salamander essence)
Earth Stone
Sulphur
Sulphur
Flaming Quill
Glow Crystal
Giant Horn

Next, you'll want to do something like this in order to ensure you've got a blank slate to work with:
Fire Stone
Fire Stone
4 Meat (This should drain Gnome to 0 again)

Now you can continue from the place I've marked as ":HERE"  :

If you're forging it raw and don't want the Plunge Attack, simply add 4 meats, and start from the beginning of the "onward to the recipe" section.

FINISHED

* Current Essences

15-15-15-15-15-14-15-14!!  Take a moment to appreciate this, this by far is the
 HIGHEST the Essences will ever get without cheating.

[[ Editor's (Myst Erik Ery's) Note: Congratulations!  Do remember that the
 varnish cuts down on Salamander by two points, which is sad...  But I believe 
that this is, in fact, the highest Essences will get.  Ever.  Heh, heh.  You 
know, though, I knew from approximately the time we learned about Aerolite's 
Bleeding properties that they would be what reaches the highest essense total.  
I do wonder what Attack Powers you'd get for SwifteRock!  Too bad Pocketstation 
was cut.. ;_;

Afterthoughts:

This is my favorite recipe yet.  Nothing but cheap items used.  ZERO Mirror Pieces needed, ZERO Glow Crystals Needed so no trading at Prof. Bombs place.  Just about every item you put into the process raises an essence one way or another.  I'd almost consider it a "quick" recipe if it didn't require so much thought :P  Not to mention tempering in 165 items is hardly considered quick :)
