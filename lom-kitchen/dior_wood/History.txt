##saricks faq##

Starting to use wizards and consumptions. Has material resistance table
translated from Ultimania, but lacks item energy chart.

##mmajarra faq##

Almost everything we know now. Lacked some fine points about wisp/shade including
how they interact with wizards. Done so well it hasn't been replaced yet...

*diorwood 75* ~~feb 2001


Lots of improvements went on, but none of the intermediate steps seem to have
been recorded. All the info to make this jump was in Marcus' faq. While its just
a matter of understanding tempering at a high level, AsianGrinch did a masterful
job. I might be able to recreate his results, but 104 in 273 items still amazes me.

(I found a post of AsianGrinches adamantite recipe from july 2001. It notes
that wisp/shade only benefit from wizards cards that appear before them)

Locartes recognizes something interesting. "psuedo draining"

I use pixies to control mirrored world, the bane of high level diorwood tempering.
