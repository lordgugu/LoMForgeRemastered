5a - Tempering Your Weapon :
	The first thing you want to do to your weapon is to max out all spirit 
levels.  This method was first posted by Ramuh Edge (nick10512@aol.com), on the 
LOM message board at www.gamefaqs.com.  I'm going to describe the technique in 
my own words.

	Each element has an opponent that it will cancel if it exists in your 
weapon.  The Chaos Stones, however, add the Ancient Moon mystic power, which 
allows them to co-exist.

Requirements : 4 Chaos Crystals, 2 silvers & a gold coin each for the first four 
cooperating elements, and 2 gold coins for each for the last four conflicting 
elements.

1. Add in two silvers and a gold coin (do silver before gold) for four spirits 
that cooperate with one another : Wisp, Dryad, Salamander, and Jinn, OR Shade, 
Aura, Undine, and Gnome.  They should now be level 4.

2. For this step, add a chaos crystal, and then another one for every two spirit 
coins you add.  To speed the process up, and to lower the required number of 
chaos crystals, you should use two golds, instead of two silvers and a gold.  Do 
this for all four spirits, and your equipment should have maxed out spirit 
levels.
