Don't remember how I got this... Just had a recipe written down in a notepad back from when I was hardcore into LoM.  Pulled it off the shelf and started playing it again, and back on it.  Figured I might as well post this up.

Any weapon should work.  I usually just buy those little cheapo 90 luccre knives for this.

Temper recipe is:

--------------------------
Oblong seed
Earthstone
Needlettuce
Chaos Crystal
Waterstone
Windstone
Firestone
Needlettuce
Pine 'O Clock
Pine 'O Clock
Pine 'O Clock
Pine 'O Clock
--------------------------

I suppose any other seed would work.  I've always used Oblong since they're really cheap to buy.

The elemental stones are purchased from a level 1 mineral shop.  250 each I think.

Chaos crystal we all know and love for 5k each.

And the Pine 'O Clocks are blue seed family, therefore planting Round seeds helps get them in stock.

So cost for me is:

Weapon (90)
Seed (10)
4 crystals (1000)
Chaos crystal (5000)
-----------
Total (6100)

Weapon sells for 40045.

Total profit:  33945 lucre

Could use any weapon, I guess.  Done it with other weapons, and just adds 40k to it's resell value, so profit may have bigger yields if it's a weapon that normally sells for more.
