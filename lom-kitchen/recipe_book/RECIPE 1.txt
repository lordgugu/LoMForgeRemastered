It's simple, really. Spend some time at Luon Highway (or even Lake 
Kilma) until you've obtained at least one WindCap (ToppleCotton Hat 
dropped by Spiny Cones) and at least four Clear Feather (Feather 
Secondary dropped by Stinger Bees and Gloomoths).

Then, simply add the four Clear Feather to the WindCap. Sell it for 
a wonderful 26 643 Lucre sum. What did you pay for it? Nothing! 
Pure profit, and lots of it.

This is the fastest way of making money in Legend of Mana.
