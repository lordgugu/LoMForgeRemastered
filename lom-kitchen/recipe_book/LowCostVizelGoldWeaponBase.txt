I use a very good level power of Wisp in this recipe.

You need maybe 14,000 gold to fuse this polar weapon.
If you have Undine Silver/Undine Gold/Gnome Silver/Gnome Gold, plus 900 gold each, each of these is worth one more stage of power.
At most you can spend about 16k for this weapon.

You'll need these things:
A chunk of VizelGold, or a base VizelGold weapon
S red/blue/yellow seed
2 Orange/Purple/Green seeds
One Flat seed
4 Spiny Carrots
3 Cornflowers 
A pair of Earth Stones
A Water Stone
A large supply of Mercury/Sulphur

And the big key, 2 Wisp Silvers.

And you can improve your weapon if you have:
Up to 3 chunks of Aura Silver
An Aura Gold
An Undine Silver/Undine Gold
A Gnome Silver/Gnome Gold
A Dryad Gold

Each of these elements requires 3 matching Sulphur/Mercury or so... they will help refine the weapon.

Let's Make It!  ^.^
FIRST -
If you don't have Aura, skip to the adding of Spiny Carrots. You can just add 4 Mercury, And proceed with that step.

- AURA SILVER (If you have only 1, Put in 3 Mercury first, and skip to the carrots)

Mercury
Mercury
Mercury
- AURA SILVER  

(If you have a 3rd Aura silver,)
Mercury
Mercury
Mercury
- AURA SILVER 

(Now if you have a gold,)
Mercury
Mercury
Mercury
- AURA GOLD

(More than 3 Silvers and 1 Gold are useless. This is just freebie buffering.)


-->>> The spiny carrot step <<<--

if you had Aura coins, you just put in your last one...
Otherwise you put in 4 Mercury, right?
(Your weapon's tray looks full of Mercury.)

- SPINY CARROT
- SPINY CARROT
- SPINY CARROT
- SPINY CARROT [Undine 4]
Mercury

WATER STONE [Undine 5]... (And skip if you have no Undine Silver/Gold)

Now the complimicated part.

Dryad Gold [Dryad 7]

NOW,you must add *4* Sulfurs, Or you will end up with a drain effect and conflicts.

Time for the big move of the weapon... 
This fast little formula is a plantly miracle :D
Add -
- Cornflower
- Cornflower
- WISP SILVER

- the GLOW CRYSTAL
- Wisp Silver ... and as you add
Sulfur - The Crystal Blows up and, [Wisp 7]... the big hat trick! ^.~

^.^
-Earth Stone
Sulfur
Sulfur
Sulfur
-Earth Stone [Gnome 5].. and if you got em',

Sulfur

Sulfur
-GNOME SILVER [Gnome 6]

Sulfur
Sulfur
Sulfur
-GNOME GOLD [Gnome 7]

If you had the basics for this weapon, You should have
[WISP 7][DRYAD 6][UNDINE 5][GNOME 5]
The overmultiplier is 39 instead of 16 ^.^ A big boost!

And if you had everything you've got
[WISP 7][AURA 7][DRYAD 7][UNDINE 7][GNOME 7]
o_o Your overmult is 51 (vs 16). That's only more than 3 times more damage.

Now you've got a nice high base, you can add the attacks, stat gains, and varnish. ^.^ Yay for Spiny Carrots, Seeds, and Cornflowers!
