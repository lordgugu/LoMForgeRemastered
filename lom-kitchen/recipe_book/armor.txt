DragonScaleArmor and AdamantitePendants are the "best" armor because
they have the highest values for material and equipment type.
Pendants also allow you to get all of the status immunities on a
single item.

1. Max armor values
Great high defense, but you can't regenerate hp.
  DragonScaleArmor 98/98/99/6
    round seed
    3 needle(ttuce)
    sleepy eye
  AdamantitePendant 0/0/0/95
    stinky breath
    fire stone
    sulpher
    sulpher
    holy water
    zombie claw
    blackened Bat
    ghost howl
    sharp claw
    water stone
    fishy fruit
    squalphin
    round seed
    3 needle(ttuce)
    moth wing

2. High armor values
Pretty much the same as the first one but uses heaven scales card
from springana so you can regenerate hp (even while moving), but
now you can't revive.
  DragonScaleArmor 65/65/68/4
    round seed
    2 needle(ttuce)
    springana
    sleepy eye
  AdamantitePendant 0/0/0/78
    stinky breath
    fire stone
    sulpher
    sulpher
    holy water
    zombie claw
    blackened Bat
    ghost howl
    sharp claw
    water stone
    fishy fruit
    squalphin
    round seed
    2 needle(ttuce)
    springana
    moth wing

3. High stats
With a maxed out hp stat you'll regenerate damage faster than you can
take it in most situations. This setup also raises your luck more than
the others can. Since the armor values aren't critical to this setup
you can make the first three items out of anything (the shoes show what
needs to change to work on wood). The pendant recipe relies on the
particular resistances of adamantite in a number of places, but it can
be replaced with menos bronze and any other material with the same
resistances.
