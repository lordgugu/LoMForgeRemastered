WEAPON BASICS

At the most basic level the attack value of a weapon is determined by 8
factors. Four are from the type of weapon, and the other four come from the
material used. Each has a value for Sharp, Heavy, Force and Tech. To get the
final attack value multiply the like values, add them together, and then
divide by 128.

(Weapon.Sharp*Material.Sharp + W.Heavy*M.H + W.Force*M.F + W.Tech*M.T)/128

Here is a list of the weapon values.
The material values can be found at material.txt.

WEAPONS   Sharp Heavy Force Tech
Knife     44    16    12    48

Example: Coral Hammer

Coral  18 21 14 12

Hammer  8 72 64 16

(18*8 + 21*72 + 14*64 + 12*16) = 2744

2744 / 128 = 21.4375

Rounding down the attack value is found to be 21


CHANGING MATERIAL VALUES

There are a number of cards and items which change a materials values. When
properly combined a weapons attack value can be increased by up to a factor
of 5.

CARDS         Sharp Heavy Force Tech
Clown         +50%  -50%             (from Bumpkin)
Cleric        -50%  +50%             (from Holy Water)
Volcano                   +50%  -50% (from Ash)

ITEMS
Sharp Claw    +50%  -50%
Giants Horn   -50%  +50%
Scissors                  +50%  -50%
Poison Fang               -50%  +50%
Clear Feather       -50%        +50%
Dragon's Breath           +25%  +25%
Wicked Eye    +25%
Silly Eye           +25%
Angry Eye                 +25%
Blank Eye                       +25%
Rhinoloupe    +25%
Spade Basil   +25%
Gold Clover         +25%
Peach Puppy   +25%  -25%
Spiny Carrot  +25%  -25%
Needlettuce   +25%  -25%
Masked Potato -25%  +25%
Citrisquid    -25%  +25%
Apricat                   -25%  +25%

You can have three cards, but only one item, and it must be the last thing
added. These last cards and item added are called the varnish. The three
varnishes most commonly used are.

3 Clowns and a Sharp Claw
3 Clerics and a Giants Horn
3 Volcanos and a Scissors

Usually the varnish can be chosen just based on the strongest stat of the
weapon.


Example: Coral Hammer
1. Add a Holy Water. Nothing happens, but thats ok. A Cleric has been produced
in the "invisible" slot and it will be pushed on by the next holy water.

Coral  18 21 14 12


2. Add another Holy Water. The first Cleric becomes visible. The Sharp value
is multiplied by .5 and the Heavy value is multiplied by 1.5, round down.

Coral   9 31 14 12


3. Add another. Two Clerics are visible.

Coral   4 46 14 12


4. Add another. Three Clerics are visible.

Coral   2 69 14 12

Adding any more Holy Waters won't improve the weapon at this point since only
three Clerics can ever be visible.


5. Add the Giants Horn.

Coral   1 103 14 12

Hammer  8  72 64 16

(1*8 + 103*72 + 14*64 + 12*16) = 8512

8512 / 128 = 66.5

So by adding the varnish the hammer went from 21 to 66. Thats an increase of
more than 3 times after adding only 5 items.


EFFECT OF INCREASED ESSENCES

Weapons also gain power when their essence total increases. To understand
this we need a new value called "growth control" or GC, which can also be
found in material.txt. The weapons attack value is multiplied by the factor.

(Essence.total + GC) / GC

If no essences have been added this factor is always 1.

Example: Coral Hammer
Lets say the hammer has an essence total of 36.
Coral has a growth control of 12.

Coral  18 21 14 12 /12

Hammer  8 72 64 16

(18*8 + 21*72 + 14*64 + 12*16) = 2744

2744 * (36 + 12) / 12 / 128 = 85.75

Rounding down gives an attack power of 85


When varnished like in the previous example...

Coral   1 103 14 12 /12

Hammer  8  72 64 16

(1*8 + 103*72 + 14*64 + 12*16) = 8512

8512 * (36 + 12) / 12 / 128 = 266

So by combining essence raising and varnishing the attack power went from 21
all the way to 266.


STATISTICAL LIMITS

An important place where system implementaion effects the equations is in the
material values. When multiplying by 1.5 the material value will never go
above 255. This only occurs when the materials base value is over 50.

Example: DragonScale Sword

DragonScale 60 66 54 54

Sword       32 32 32 32

A heavy varnish would seem to be best since heavy is the highest base stat.

DragonScale 3 333 54 54 (3*32+333*32+54*32+54*32)/128=111
  capped    3 255 54 54 (3*32+255*32+54*32+54*32)/128=91

Varnishing for force would give...

DragonScale 60 66 271 3 (60*32+66*32+271*32+3*32)/128=100
  capped    60 66 255 3 (60*32+66*32+255*32+3*32)/128=96

Without a cap heavy would be the better varnish, but with the cap it turns out
force is best.
