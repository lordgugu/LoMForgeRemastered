RESULTS:
Following the recipe above will give you a weapon with all the essence markers,
50 total essences, +3 to all stats, and approximately these attack powers.
spear 336
2Haxe 284
2Hsword 284
knife 283
bow 263
sword 227

The other weapons produce better results under slightly different conditions.
Using holy waters instead of the bumpkins and a giants horn instead of the
sharp claw will give approximately these results.
hammer 446
flail 275
staff 271
axe 248
glove 242


THEORY I (cardless tempering):
This is a listing of just the carded ingredients. To the side are the cards
present when the cardless items are added.

The first thing you should notice is that the (first slot) isn't visible on
your weapon.
The second thing you should notice is that in the first 6 cases the three
visible slots contain one element card and 2 wizard cards. This situation
reduces elemental resistances and allows us to get the most out of our gold
clovers.
In the next two cases there is an ancient moon card instead of a second
wizard card. The ancient moon card is needed to get rid of the conflict
which would normally prevent the last two elements from rising.
In the last case the clown cards increase one aspect of the weapon while
decreasing another. The sharp claw has a similar effect.
