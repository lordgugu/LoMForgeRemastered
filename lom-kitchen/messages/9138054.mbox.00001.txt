It's simple, really.  Spend some time at Luon Highway (or even Lake 
Kilma) until you've obtained at least one WindCap (ToppleCotton Hat 
dropped by Spiny Cones) and at least four Clear Feather (Feather 
Secondary dropped by Stinger Bees and Gloomoths).

Then, simply add the four Clear Feather to the WindCap.  Sell it for 
a wonderful 26 644 Lucre sum.  What did you pay for it?  Nothing!  
Pure profit, and lots of it.

This is the fastest way of making money in Legend of Mana.

This is a Tempering Riddle. The first person to solve the riddle 
wins!

This Riddle is titled "Witches of Moons?" and is ranked at ***/***** 
(3 out of 5) stars in difficulty.

One day, young Yvanne went to her workshops to do some Tempering. 
She found an old dusty MenosBronze Helmet in her inventory. Looking 
at it, she discoverd that it had the following stats:
Undine: 5
Jinn: 3
Gnome: 5
Salamander: 5

Mystic Cards:
Witch
Ancient Moon
Witch of Moon

Now, Yvanne realizes that Jinn is somewhat low. She wants to have 5 
Jinn, and not 3.
However, she really likes those Mystic Cards! She needs your help 
because she isn't very good at Tempering! Since her MenosBronze Helm 
is so old, she can't even remember what she added last, so she could 
have anything in the Invisible Slot!

Here's what you have to find out:

What items could Yvanne add to her MenosBronze Helm in order to 
raise Jinn to 5 -- without changing any other essences -- but still 
end up with the same Cards - in the same order?

You will receive bonus points if you use six or less items.

Welcome to another Riddle!  This one is titled:
"Yvanne and the Sevent'eight Cards", and is ranked at ***/*****
(3 out of 5) stars in difficulty.

A few days after trying to learn how to temper, Yvanne decided to 
make a MenosBronze Hat.  Realizing that MenosBronze has resistances 
of 8, she decided to add eight items to it.
She added:
2 Gold Coins
2 Crystals
2 Produce
1 Pouch
1 Vial

As she did this, she noticed different Mystic Cards coming and 
going.  After tempering all eight items into her new MenosBronze Hat, 
she was left with:
Tower/Mirrored World/Ancient Moon

You job is to find out what she added.  To help you out, Yvanne's 
friend Dilly-Bob wrote down what kinds of Mystic Cards he saw.  In 
addition, he sneaked on to play Yvanne's game, and added a Lilipods 
to her MenosBronze Hat, noting down what kind of card the final last 
Mystic Card was.
He had noted down that there were 2 Maiden Cards, 2 Essence Cards, 2 
World Cards, and 2 Stage Cards, in no particular order.

Yvanne says that she did not add two of the same item in, so what 
items did she add, and in what order?

Here's a re-cap:
8 Items Added:
2 Gold Coins
2 Crystals
2 Produce
1 Pouch
1 Vial
8 Mystic Cards:
2 Maiden
2 Essense
2 World
2 Stage
(The final Mystic Card is in the invisible slot, which was bumped out 
when Dilly-Bob added his own Lilipods)

Bonus points if you can figure out a way that works that isn't the 
same way Yvanne did it!

Okay . . . 
Witch of Moon requires >4 Undine and Jinn = 0, so Jinn had to be added
 after the Witch of Moon.  Therefore there *should* be a Jinn in the
hidden spot.  Since she wants to keep the current cards, to raise Jinn
she will need to use high energy items that don't produce cards.

So Jinn *should* rise to 5 with the addition of 3 Dialaurels.

Now, you're not quite correct, but it's a good idea.  Essence Cards 
in the Invisible Slot, however, do not give TPs.  So, you wouldn't be 
able to add anything by simply using Dialaurels.  They do, however, 
give TPs on the turn they enter - but they she would have different 
Cards.
Try to think of another way to get Witch of Moon while Jinn > 0, and 
you can easily raise Jinn and then pop on another Witch of Moon 
(especially since Ancient Moon and Witch are very easy to get back 
on).

With Adamantine, I'm not too sure - just try all three, and get back 
to us with which is better.

Swords are difficult to varnish for, because their 
Sharp/Heavy/Force/Tech values are all the same -- It all depends on 
the Material values.

For Dragonscale, I think that the best varnish is the 3 Clown Card + 
Sharp Claw varnish.

For DiorWood, I KNOW the best varnish will be the 3 Volcano + 
Scissors varnish.

Adamantine might be the 3 Cleric + Giant's Horn varnish, but I'm not 
sure.

Alright, folks.  Here's what's done!
I've completed entering the Mystic Card Database - if you have any 
suggestions or questions about it, feel free to ask.  It's in the 
Database section, and if you use 'View Printable Report', it's much 
nicer to read (I think).
Second, I've completed and perfected a request -- a PearlRing.  
However, the recipe will work for both a ring AND a Pendant, and will 
work for any material you wish so long as it has 6, 7, or 8 
resistances all around (so MenosBronze, Pearl, Dragonscales, and so 
on).  The result will have rather good stat boosts (more if you 
double (or triple) up on the Toadstoolsheds), Extra Lucre gain, 
Freeze and Sleep protection, and 3 essences across the board.  Woo!
It's cheap, too, only needing a single Chaos Crystal and 3 Moth Wings 
(other than a couple other things which aren't too difficult, they're 
all listed).
Any other requests?

Now, here's what's to come!
Soon, I will start entering the Item Database, which will be 
rather... well, troublesome for me.  You see, Items have many 
different properties: Bonus (Limitations), Price, Name, Group, ID, 
Mystic Card, Essence Requirements for Mystic Card, Weapon/Armor 
Bonuses, Energy, and Special Effects (not to mention where you can 
find the item, which I'm going to put in a different table due to the 
fact that there's.. well, many places!)..
I've got to fit all of that on one table.  Wish me luck!
After that, I'll start with a Pet List -- telling you each Pet 
Monster, the Type, the Starting Stats, and the Stat Gain per level.
To accompany that will be a Monster List -- telling you where to find 
each kind of monster and what items that monster will drop.
Later, even more tables... Not sure of what, yet.
In any case, that's all hard stuff.  More recipes will be made, 
however, so that will be fun!  ^_^

Alright, thanks folks!

Here's a simple formula that will work for any Metals (that have the 
same resistance for all essences) and most other things, as well.  
You will need 5 Mercury, 5 Sulpher, 1 Silver of each essence, 1 Chaos 
Crystal, and as many Flaming Quill and Gold Clover as you can get 
your hands on.

Mercury
Mercury
Shade Silver
Sulpher
ADD* UNTIL THIS ESSENCE WON'T RISE ANYMORE: Shade
Sulpher
Wisp Silver
Aura Silver
ADD* UNTIL THIS ESSENCE WON'T RISE ANYMORE: Wisp
Mercury
ADD* UNTIL THIS ESSENCE WON'T RISE ANYMORE: Aura
Mercury
Undine Silver
Gnome Silver
ADD* UNTIL THIS ESSENCE WON'T RISE ANYMORE: Undine
Sulpher
Sulpher
Dryad Silver
ADD* UNTIL THIS ESSENCE WON'T RISE ANYMORE: Gnome
Sala Silver
ADD* UNTIL THIS ESSENCE WON'T RISE ANYMORE: Dryad
Sulpher
Glow Crystal
Mercury
ADD* UNTIL THIS ESSENCE WON'T RISE ANYMORE: Salamander
Jinn Silver
Holy Water
ADD* UNTIL THIS ESSENCE WON'T RISE ANYMORE: Jinn
Holy Water
Holy Water
Lilipods
Giant's Horn

*You will be adding either Flaming Quill (until you raise Jinn -- 
then you MUST use Gold Clover) or Gold Clover.

Be care of Wisp and Shade - don't let Wisp get higher than Shade (so 
if Wisp=Shade, stop adding the Flaming Quill / Gold Clover).
Otherwise, you should be fine!

I hope it makes a suitable weapon for you.

My bad!  It's supposed to be a Chaos Crystal, not a Glow Crystal ;)

I just got to level 99. I want to get the rest of the skills for the 
weapons, and I figured I might as well make good weapons to do it 
with. I've been trying to get Adamantite, AltenaAlloy, Dragon 
Scales, DiorWood, and FullMetal, but I haven't had any luck.

I was hoping I could make some decent weapons from LorimarIron or 
something else that I can buy. Can someone give me recipes for each 
weapon with pretty good power? I have one for a 350 power sword, but 
I need adamantite for it.

If you're having trouble getting DiorWood, Dragonscales, and 
Adamantine, you should make yourself a +20 all equipment, or four.
It's rather simple.  Take almost any material (though, you'll want 8 
or less Dryad resistance, or you're going to have to use Gold Clover 
instead of Wicked Eye) (NON-WOOD), and add:

Any Seed
Sulpher
Sulpher
Needle
Wicked Eye
Wicked Eye
Spiny Seed
Poison Fang
Spiny Seed
Card-Making Item
X Meat (until +20 all)
Creepy Eye / Moth Wing (for more Magic Defense)

Then you'll get +80 Luck, if you make yourself three +20 All 
rings/pendants and a +20 all weapon (though, it'll take longer to 
bring down Level 99 Dragons and such, if you do it to your weapon, 
too).

And bring a Polterbox.

By the way - the QuickRecipe works on all kinds of equipment.  You 
can try that...

Note that LorimarIron isn't very good for swords, though.

I read about a plunge attack that sets people on fire and does 
continuous damage. What other plunge techniques are there? Are there 
any other ones with unique abilities or ones that look cool? Thanks.

Also, how late in the tempering process can plunge attacks be worked 
in, or can you put them in any time during the process of tempering, 
including afterwards?

In the Mystic Card List I have in the Database of this group, you'll 
see which Cards produce which Plunge Attacks in which Weapons.

Unfortunately, Plunge Attacks do not look any different from the 
usual Thrust / Uppercut / Jump Plunges, though they may have 
different effects.

You can add these in at any time, and they will replace the current 
Thrust / Uppercut / Jump Plunges, depending on which slot the Plunge 
Attack takes.

For more information, go to 
http://www.geocities.com/xo_pitseleh/lom.html and read the section on 
Plunge Attacks.

As far as varnishing goes, you'll have to refer to Material and 
Weapon Tables that I haven't got ahold of yet.  Generally, Force-
weapons include Axes and two-handed Axes, Sharp-weapons include 
Spears, Bows, and Knives, Heavy-weapons include Flail, Gloves, Staff, 
and Hammer, and Swords don't fit into any category.

:)

This is something that I had posted on the GameFAQs board. It is 
exactly what you are looking for.

Method 1: Clown x3, Sharp Claw
Method 2: Volcano x3, Scissors
Method 3: Cleric x3, Giant's Horn

Dagger: Method 1
Sword: See Below
Axe: Method 2
2H Sword: See Below
2H Axe: Method 2
Hammer: Method 3
Spear: Method 1
Staff: Method 3
Glove: Method 3
Flail: Method 3
Bow: Method 1

Sword and 2H Sword are special in that they don't have a strong 
aspect to their attack power. So that means you can use any of the 
three methods you like. However, if you have a partner that raises a 
certain attack type by syncing, refer to the attack types listed with 
the Methods.

Method 1 - Slashing/Piercing/Jabbing. With the edge of the weapon.
Method 2 - Force. A deeply cutting hit.
Method 3 - Heavy/Blunt. A bashing attack.

There "should" be a 4th method, but there is no Mystic Card for the 
4th attack stat, Technique. If there were, Knife, Glove, and Flail 
would all use that instead.

Actually, the Knife is still best suited with Sharp-type boosts (3x 
Clown Card, Sharp Claw), whereas the Bow would be better if there was 
a +50% Tech -50% Force Card.  :)

Sharp: Knife, Spear
Force: Axe, 2H Axe
Heavy: Staff, Hammer
Tech: Bow, Flail, Gloves
None: Sword, 2H-Sword

So, originally, there is two weapons in each category except for 
Tech, which also has the Bow.
Now, however, the Bow is moved to the "Sharp" group, and the 
Flail/Gloves to the "Heavy" Group, making it more like:

Sharp: Knife, Spear, Bow
Force: Axe, 2H Axe
Heavy: Staff, Hammer, Flail, Gloves
None: Sword, 2H-Sword

Which isn't really as nicely balanced as what it should be.  ^_^

Dragonscales Gloves would start out better than a DiorWood one, but 
I'm fairly certain that at much higher essence levels, DiorWood makes 
a better weapon overall, no matter what that weapon is...

Use the QuickRecipe, I'd suggest, since that should get you a 300+ 
Attack Power ScaleGloves, I'd think.

^_^ If you want the Uber-Dragonscales Recipe (that gets you 
15/15/15/14/15/9/15/9 essences), you'd have to ask, though, since 
it's very long and requires a lot of Mirror Pieces...

I'd like to see it. How many is a lot???

Heres a recipe I'm working on which will get to 100 with no mirror 
pieces. Err, at least I think so, I'm only about half way through it 
myself. =_=

Notes:
X=coin of the element you're trying to raise
fq=flaming quill
m=mercury for shade,aura,jinn,undine
 =sulpher for wisp,dryad,sala,gnome

Blocks-2nd element won't raise if the first is present (generally 
the 1st element also drains the second)
(wisp blocks shade, aura blocks dryad, sala blocks gnome blocks jinn 
blocks undine blocks sala)

Supports-2nd element won't drain if the 1st is present (this is a 
BAD thing)
(sala supports jinn supports sala, gnome supports undine supports 
gnome)

If the ? was a ghost howl then

Mirrored world is only produced by a mirror piece.
Ancient moon is only produced by a chaos crystal.
Tower is produced by healing claw and rocket papaya. But we know she 
didn't use a claw.
To get two world cards at the same time we need a bed of thorns. So 
either a needle or a needlelettuce.
But we already know our pouch was a mirror piece.
Tower needs wisp present and bed of thorns needs dryad present.
So we're left with 2 maidens which are produced by a vial and a 
crystal.
That must be nymph of dawn(glow crystal) and sacrificed nymph(ghost 
howl).
For order; dryad before needlelettuce, wisp before papaya rocket, 
bed of thorns before world cards,
but still close enough to be active when they enter.

This works:
dryad gold
needlelettuce
wisp gold
glow crystal
chaos crystal
mirror piece
papaya rocket
ghost howl

There are 24 possible arrangements.

I believe you got both of those correct!  Great job! ^_^

Glad to know you know what you're talking about, here.

:)

I wonder what kind of riddle I should make up next?

I highly suggest reading Marcus Majarra's FAQ.  After
you do that, read it again.  If you still don't
understand...read it again.

Tempering really is that complex.  You won't
understand it instantly.

Well, the best place to start, for me to help you (at least), is if 
you ask questions.  Ask questions.  And then ask more questions.

If I had to recommend a FAQ, I'd suggest reading MMajarra's FAQ (at 
www.gamefaqs.com for those of you who don't know about it) a few 
times, at least the first part of it.

However, MMajarra's FAQ has a number of flaws and missing sections, 
which overall is not too bad, but tends to make me frusterated with 
him for being stingy about recipes (he burns people at the stake, you 
see)... Now, if he were to UPDATE his FAQ, it'd be much better >_>
And he shouldn't use 'don't have the game right now, can't test' as 
an excuse, considering that I don't have the game right now, and I 
still manage to test things, simply by asking other people to do the 
testing for me...

So, after you understand the inial aspects of Tempering, the best way 
to learn for you is to experiment and ask questions about the results.
Wonder why you can't create an Ancient Moon Card when you have 
Yggdrasil/Beast-Headed God/Yggdrasil?  Wonder why Sulpher and Mercury 
are really needed?  Ask.

But read the FAQs first, so that you come with a little bit of 
knowledge, so I can figure out where to _start_.

:)

   Maby it's me and if so then Ill feel really stupid but, having 
looked on gamefaqs and this group and the board for Legend of Mana I 
cant seem to find anyone who has any recomendations for staff 
weapons. are they just not popular? anywayz I want to make a staff 
with power in the 800's minimum anyone have any suggestions or should 
I just follow the complete tempering process for the DiorWood Bow 
posted on gamefaqs by MMajarra  and use a staff instead? if anyone 
can give me a few pointers I would really apprichate it. (I am sure 
there are some spelling errors I know I cant spell *sorry*)

1. Learn about the very basics of cards by tempering clear feathers 
into windcaps. The first one you temper has no visible effect but it 
increases the value of the cap. The next one you temper will show a 
Lord of Flies card being added and the value of the item will go up 
again. This will also happen for the next two clear feathers you 
add. But any you add after that will have no effect. This should 
teach you two things. First that there is one invisible slot in 
addition to the three visible card slots. Second that this is a 
great way to make money. (clear feathers come from stinger bees and 
windcaps come from spiny cones, both of which can be found on the 
luon highway)
extra credit: What happens when you add clear feathers to a cap you 
forge yourself? Why?

Quite honestly, Staves suck.  I believe their *maximum* attack power 
is second only to Gloves, with Flails still managing to top them.
The best Staff you can make is out of Dragonscales.  It'd be possible 
to make a 400+ Attack Power Staff simply by using the QuickRecipe on 
this site.
Otherwise, you'll have to use some higher forms of Tempering... You 
could make a 9/9/9/9/9/9/9/9 Staff pretty easily, if you learn about 
energy and such.  That Staff probably won't reach 800 Attack Power, 
but still...

If you want Golden Touch, you can't add Cleric Cards to your Staff 
(as Demonicide will replace Golden Touch).  Therefore, your attack 
power potential drops about 100 points, considering the best varnish 
for Staves is 3x Cleric + Giant's Horn.

If you want something similar to Golden Touch, you're better off 
using Gloves and the Hand of Midas Plunge Attack.  Hand of Midas 
turns all experience crystals into Lucre, just like Golden Touch, 
except it's for the Gloves, and is created by the King Card.
Then you can use Cleric Cards to boost your attack power higher, 
since Cleric doesn't add a Plunge Attack to Gloves.

I'll read this over later on (I've got to run to school), but I have 
to say that if Salamander drops to 0, your Salamander Marker should 
leave.  You can't have Bed of Thorn otherwise, you see...

I finally figured out how to do what marcus had been hinting at.


>> fire stone
>> giants horn
>> chaos crystal
>> needlelettuce

Sala starts at 0 and conflicting elements keep it from rising. The 
needleettuce is put on seeing 0 sala so it makes a bed of thorns. 
And it also pushes on the chaos crystal which allows sala to rise 
which gives the sala marker.

Aha!  Making it simpler that way!  You'd then, of course, simply use 
the Needlettuce to make the two Yggdrasil you need, and stuff the 
Evil God Card in the middle (which allows you one more Card, like 
Goddess of Love for a pendant), and top it off with a bunch of meats, 
and a Creepy Eye.

Good thinking.  I'm not too sure why I didn't think about that.

Sorry I didn't have time to look it over ^_^ I'm going to ponder it a 
bit, now, mostly around your disappearing-World-Card tricks...  I'm 
going to see if more items tend to remove World Cards.
Would you like to do some tests for me?  :)

Try this:
Springanana
Flaming Quill
Lilipods

Does the Heaven's Scale enter?

How about:
Springanana
Gold Clover
Lilipods

??

Springanana
Sun Crystal
Lilipods

??

Springanana
Moon Crystal
Lilipods

??

Springanana
Bellgrapes
Lilipods

??

Springanana
Mangoelephant
Lilipods

??

Springanana
Applesocks
Lilipods

??

Springanana
Gold Clover
Lilipods

??

Springanana
Rocket Papaya
Lilipods

??

Springanana
Orange'opus
Lilipods

??

Springanana
Dialaurel
Lilipods

??

Springanana
Toadstoolshed
Lilipods

??

Springanana
Dragon Blood
Lilipods

??

Springanana
Acid
Lilipods

??

Springanana
Blackened Bat
Lilipods

??

Depending on these answers, I might have a reason for a lack of World 
Cards...  ^__^

Or not.  It might be another lone case.  Oh well.  I'll try these if 
you don't.  ^_^

Actually, I think Marcus was referring to having added a Sala-Card 
Creating item that gives all of its energy to Wisp/Shade/Dryad/Aura, 
and so has no more left for Salamander.  Thus, you have the 
oppurtunity for later Salamander TPs without adding any additional 
Cards after the Bed of Thorn (allowing you to have room for the two 
Yggdrasil Cards).  An example would be having:

(Sorcerer)
Sorcerer
Dryad
[Card]

With Dryad at 4, on Adamantite (resistance 8/6/3/1), Dryad requires 3 
* 2^4 = 48 energy.  Now, if you add a Sala Silver, you'd get 48 
energy, and end up with (Sala)Sorcerer/Sorcerer/Dryad.  At this 
point, you can simply add a Needlettuce, which would raise Salamander 
to 1 (even if you added a Needle, which only gives 8 energy).  Then, 
the next thing that you add will raise Salamander to 2.
Top it off with Spiny Seed + Evil God (more difficult to work in, 
with the above, unless you use a Ragnarok Trick) + Spiny Seed.
Here's how to get a Ragnarok Trick to work.

You have: (Yggdrasil)Bed of Thorn/Salamander/Sorcerer.
Now add a non-Wicked Eye (Pixie)Yggdrasil/Bed of Thorn/Sorcerer.
Now add a Spiny Seed (Yggdrasil)Pixie/Yggdrasil/Bed of Thorn.
Now add a Pine o'Clock (Ragnarok)Yggdrasil/Pixie/Yggdrasil.
Now add any Cardless item, and you'll end up with (---)Yggdrasil/Evil 
God/Yggdrasil.
From there, you can add your Varnish Item (which would be whatever 
you'd like the Effect to be [since Bed of Thorn turns the effect into 
No Regeneration], of course) and top it off with a Creepy Eye (for 
Magic Defense -- on a Pendant, a Moth Wing would work just as well, 
since the reduction in the other defenses is irrelevant).

:)

It's divide by 4, truncate, then multiply by 3.  If the result is 0, 
the resistance is then equal to 1.  Here's a mini-chart:

1/1/1/1 (there IS no resistance 1, but...)
2/1/1/1 (and there IS no resistance 2...)
3/1/1/1 (nor is there a resistance 3...)
4/3/1/1 (or a resistance 4!)
5/3/1/1
6/3/1/1
7/3/1/1
8/6/3/1
9/6/3/1
10/6/3/1
11/6/3/1
32/18/12/9

^_^

So you could theorize Resistance 13, and so on, using this formula.

No, actually.  The Ancient Moon in the invisible slot was being 
treated as a World Card :) Replace your Chaos Crystal with a Grave 
Dirt (or some other World-Card-Creating Item, and since it will 
similarily vanish, you've no problem)

I'm still not sure why this is...  I'll have to look at how 
Yggdrasil, Ancient Moon, and Bed of Thorn work with each other.

round seed
sulpher
sulpher
sulpher
gold clover (dryad=5)
poison fang
chaos crystal/lilipod
needlettuce
ghosts howl
spiny seed
ghosts howl

When using the chaos crystal yggdrasil doesn't push on, but with the 
lilipod it does. So maybe its getting ejected by ancient moon before 
the bed of thorns effect gets taken into account.

That seems to be it.

round seed
chaos crystal
needlettuce
chaos crystal
chaos crystal

The ones at the end don't get pushed on.

the lvl 2 shops to by the items, or am I looking int he right places. 
I know there are shops in geo and gato, and the harbor, but might it

If you have (BedofThorn)AncientMoon/Dryad/---
And add a Chaos Crystal... You get (---)BedofThorn/AncientMoon/Dryad?

If that's the case, then the Bed of Thorn is only checked for in the 
three visible slots... and to remedy it, simply add a Grave Dirt 
(etc.) just in front of the World Card you'd like to create multiples 
of.

In your previous example, the Bed of Thorn IS present.  Strange.
It might be that Bed of Thorn only gives the Multiple-World-Card 
Effect if Sala=0, but that wouldn't work for the second example.

This is extremely weird.  I'll look into it some more.  Try to post 
the Card composition of your items after each step, sofar as the test-
examples go.

In Geo, you look in the Cafe "Hello, Carl!" - talk to the Teapo in 
the corner.
In Gato Grottoes, there's a student right at the village.  He's 
selling the materials.
In Lumina, the shop "Mummy Seeker" is where you need to find -- it's 
off to the left, on Morning Moon Alley.
In Polpota Harbor, there's a student right at the seaside shop 
region.  He's selling the materials.

If you don't have a Level 2 Shop anywhere, you'll have to wait until 
your next time through the game (during a New Game + ) to place your 
Lands more carefully, to ensure you can purchase Mercury and 
Sulpher.  Following the www.gamefaqs.com Map / AF Placement FAQ might 
be wise.

The reason that your Yggdrasil didn't appear is here:

http://s2.cgi.gamefaqs.com/boards/genmessage.asp?
board=24026&topic=7261885

In other words, the older World Card was preventing Yggdrasil from 
appearing, despite the presence of Bed of Thorn.

Sorry.  You kind have to type it out, rather than click on the link.

It's at the www.gamefaqs.com message board, though.

Does mana lvls decide what shop lvls will be when you place them on 
the map? Or is it the order that determinds the lvls?

Order, and distance from home.

> How can I play the instrument?
To play for spirits you need to have an unequipped instrument.

> 1. Which better? 2HSword or Staff?
Each weapon has its strengths. Some are fast and allow lots of hits 
(glove/flail). Others are slower and do more damage (2Hswords/2Haxe).
Staff is good if you like using magic. You might also try spears and 
bows as they have good range.

> 2. How can I tempering a great weapon from either 2Hsword and

Try using the QuickRecipe. Its under files and should give you a 
pretty good weapon even using VizelGold.

> 3. Where and what monster dropped dragonsclaes(except this,a

Dragons (sky/land but not kid) drop dragonscales.
Woodings drop diorwood.
And nothing drops Mirror Pieces (there is a fixed number per game)

> 4. What mirror piece use for?
Reversing some tempering properties. You probably won't need them 
useless you get very serious about tempering.
I've never used them and I've got a 529 prevarnish spear.

The recipe assumes that shade/wisp resistances are similar. If 
they're not then wisp rising above shade would drain all the shade. 
Any imbalance at those steps could mess up the dryad/aura steps.
Moving the shade/wisp step til after the dryad/aura step would solve 
part of the problem. And a note not to raise wisp above shade could 
be helpful.

They'd have to be from the same of the following set:
[5,6,7] (Resistance 1 with Two Wizards)
[8,9,10] (Resistance 3 with Two Wizards)

With 64 energy, the first group can get to level 6.
With 64 energy, the second group can get to level 5.
When Wisp is in the first group, and shade is in the second group, 
you must ensure that Wisp doesn't grow past level 6.

Thus, you must be careful on these materials:

VizelGold
LorimarIron
All Woods
Marble
PedanStone
LizardScales
ToppelCotton
Sultan'sSilk
All Aerolites

I'll revise the QuickRecipe file as soon as I can.
Thank you, Biquts!  I didn't really mean for the QuickRecipe to be 
anything spectacular, but I might as well do my best.

You will find Mana Spirits at Boss Locations after you've beaten that 
boss.  For example, return to Du'Inke's room in the Mekiv Caverns, or 
to the Lorant Tablelands of Luon Highway (where you fought Mantis 
Ant).  You will find Spirits in these places if you have an 
instrument available (not equipped), and have finished Magical 
Instruments 101.  You might also have to enter these areas a number 
of times before the Spirits will come out.

You'll have to do "Magical Instruments 101" before you can find 
Spirits.
To open this event, place the AF Sand Rose (from either "Faeries' 
Light" or "Huntin' Du'Cate") and complete "Reach for the Stars" --- 
don't leave during that Event, however, or you'll fail it, and won't 
be able to start "Magical Instruments 101" this time through.
Then, return to your workshops to start "Magical Instruments 101".  
You'll learn how to catch Spirits once you've found them.  When 
you've finished, be sure to tell Li'l Cactus about it, as this is an 
Event that stays completed even in a New Game +, so this would be 
your only chance to have it recorded in the Cactus Diaries.
Finally, once that Event is done, you may catch Spirits.

artifact,and I placed it.Then when I try to going in,I realize that 
even in my old seva dtaa i HAVEN'T ENTERED IT YET ^^;.And I finished 
Reach For The Stars event and didn't go out(since it is too easy) 
even before I read this message!Btw,should I finished Golem Make Em

First:

int(MaterialStat * modifier)  --- For all four MaterialStats, and all 
four modifiers (three Cards, and the last item tempered).
If the result is over 255, it becomes 255.
Then:

int( MaterialStat * (Essenses + Growth Control)/Growth Control )  --- 
For all four MaterialStats.
Then:

int( MaterialStat * WeaponStat / 128 )  --- For all four Material and 
WeaponStats (paired accordingly).
Then:

Attack Power = SharpResult + HeavyResult + ForceResult + TechResult

Voila!

I'm in the process of creating a LOM website that will offer a one-
stop, decent looking, helpful guide on how to play and complete LOM.

Here's the url: http://lom.solardreamstudios.com/

The site is still in beta development and it will contain the 
following features:

- Complete Walkthrough including AF Placement. Obviously there are 
multiple ways to complete the game but I will offer a single 
solution. It will allow the user to finish all of the Events, find 
all of the wandering Pets, and obtain all of the levels of material 
from the shops.

- Encyclopedia details including scanned images from the Ultimania 
Guide. So far, I will offer a complete Bestiary with images, 
Produce/Meat info with images, Mystic Card images, and Character 
details with images.

I'm playing through the game on my PC with the ePSXe emulator and I 
will take screenshots along the way.

In the future I will offer a PDF of each page of the site as well as 
a complete PDF with all of the pages.

Hopefully this will benefit the LOM community. If anyone has any 
ideas or comments, please send them my way.

Thanks for your time and assistance.

I was looking over the material properties list and I noticed that 
the hides and skins (Animal Hide, GatorSkin, CentaurHide, DragonSkin) 
all had very low (1) heavy, force, and tech values, but much higher 
value in slash.  I thought this was very unusual since the hides and 
skins make decent gloves and they have a power multiple of 0 for 
Slash and multiple of 56 for Tech.

Is it possible the values for Tech and Slash are transposed for skins 
and hides?  If that is the case the values for the fabrics 
(ToppleCotton, Sultan'sSilk, JuddHemp, AltenaFelt) and other 
materials as well (I think it is odd that things like Adamantite and 
Fullmetal should have a higher Tech value then Slash).

Who came up with the list and how did they arrive at the values 
(which is still awesome, just confusing)?

It was taken directly from charts in the game, by someone I don't 
remember the name of.  They did a rom-dump and took the values right 
out.
I know that ToppelCotton, at least, is correct --- if you make a 
ToppelCotton Flail, you'll see that it'll have 0 Attack Power.

Also note that the order is Sharp, Heavy, Force, and Tech.  :) Not 
Slash, really.
Well, you can call it whatever you want, but the Mystic Card Database 
calls "Slash" "Sharp" when dealing with Weapon Properties.

I've not noticed hides and skins giving decent gloves - I would 
suspect that the gloves would have 0 Attack Power.

That chart does bother me, though, but in a different area than what 
you're thinking:

Marble.  12 / 2 / 21 / 16

It's very bizarre how Marble's lowest stat is Heavy.  I wonder why 
this is?  Would Marble then make a really crappy hammer?

This is either a fault of me, the original rom-dumper, or the 
translators (or even the programmers themselves)...  I don't know.
I'd have to check whether hides make decent gloves and whether marble 
makes a decent hammer...

  Well, to stop getting pixies I would recommend not tempering any more eyes into your equipment. I'm pretty sure that that's all that gives pixie cards.

  For tempering in general, I would reccomend going to www.gamefaqs.com and reading MarcusMajarra's tempering FAQ. It's incorrect on a few points, but it's by far the best FAQ out there.

  If you have any more specific questions, feel free to ask them here.

The following items create Pixie Cards:
Sleepy Eye
Blank Eye
Creepy Eye
Angry Eye
Silly Eye
Dangerous Eye
Rust
Knockout Dust
Poison Powder
Sleepy Powder
Stinky Breath

So if you can avoid it, don't use these items.  If you do, however, 
get a Pixie on your equipment, you can remove it only in two 
different ways.
The first is to add Holy Water or Garlicrown to your item when 
there's a Pixie in Slot 3 --- Holy Water and Garlicrown remove the 
stickiness of a Pixie Card for a single turn, allowing the Pixie Card 
to leave as normal.
The second is to add the Ragnarok Card.  You can't do this if all 
four Slots are Pixie Cards (ie. even the invisible slot is stuck as a 
Pixie card), but if you have three or less Pixie Cards, you can do 
this on any non-Wood item.  First, make sure you have Salamander, 
Gnome, Jinn, and Undine all at least 1.  Then, simply add a Pine 
o'Clock and then any item, and all of the Pixie Cards should turn 
into their corresponding Evil God Cards.  Since Evil God Cards do not 
stick, you can boot them off normally.

Unless you're fairly good at tempering, the first method is obviously 
reccomended.

  You know, it never occured to me before that we must have a chatroom. I always just thought of this as an email list.

  I went there when I got this message, but there was no one there anymore. I don't think people use it very often.

i've been reading about how you can attain a cerain amount of stats 
thru items, and so many questions came to me... well i just thought 
i'd ask basicly if anyone can give a bit of advice on this, thru 
maybe a example of what you did... As to what items could or can be 
best used to getting the maximum amount of stats thru the levels...

I think 1h sword gets you the most balanced stats, although using 
different weapons will get you higher stats in specific areas ie bow 
puts up skill the most

1) Could someone provide me with recipes for tempering weapons (spear 
and bow) and armors (haurbek, full armor, ring, boots and helmet) 
good enough to beat Nightmare mode?

2) Is it possible to create/temper a ForbiddenRing and/or a 
ReviveRing?

3) It is possible to increase the defensive power of a Captain's 
Helm? When I temper something into it the defensive power drops.

4) Which is the best material for weapons and/or armors?

5) What's the Draupnir Ring good for? Can you improve it by tempering?

6) Do you have any tips on improving my chances of getting DiorWood, 
DrangonScale and Adamantine? 

7) Is LorimalIron the best material I can buy?

Any help will be appreciated.

  Not me, sorry. Wait until someone who can help with this signs on, I guess.


  2) Is it possible to create/temper a ForbiddenRing and/or a

  Yes. MarcusMajarra's FAQ has recipes for these.

  3) It is possible to increase the defensive power of a Captain's

  Most enemy equipment drops have artificially high attack/defense values. When you first temper an enemy drop, the attack/defense drops down to its normal value. After that, you must temper it like a normal item to improve it. I have no recipes.

  4) Which is the best material for weapons and/or armors?

  I think for armour, it's AltenaAlloy for all stats except magic defense, and Adamantite for magic defense. For MOST weapon types, Adamantite is the best with little tempering, DragonScales is the best with moderate tempering, and DiorWood is the best with max essences.

  5) What's the Draupnir Ring good for? Can you improve it by tempering?

  I think it makes enemies drop more money. You can improve the defense power by tempering, but if I remember correctly, it's made of OakWood like all the other starting effect rings, and therefore cannot achieve defense powers even considered "decent", let alone "good".

  6) Do you have any tips on improving my chances of getting DiorWood, 
  DrangonScale and Adamantine?

  Get a Polterbox.

  7) Is LorimalIron the best material I can buy?

  I think so.

  Any help will be appreciated. 

  Hope I helped!

I just got my first polterbox... now what???
I've been looking for what produce gives luck, but i've had no luck 
acutally getting the produce I need.
The only one that I have got is mush-in-a-box, and it seems not to 
help the polterbox luck at all.
Anyone know seed placement for rare or very rare +luck produce.

Dialaurel, Gold Clover, Squalphin, Toadstoolshed, Pine O' Clock.

Secondly, whats the best personality for a polterbox?

  Actually, luck is completely useless on a polterbox. It only benefits from the luck if it makes the kill, and then it doesn't benefit from the synchro.

  The best personalities would be Friendly and Lonely, which will make the box stand closer to you, and therefore more likely to be standing next to you when you finish the enemy.

First.  thx for the info on the polterbox... any advise on ways to 
make luck items and + stat items.... atm i'm still in the norm diff 
i hav'nt beaten the game, yet... so far i've only been about to get 
+1 to all stats, and +3 to luck on a vizel silver sword i beleave 
which was 30 dmg to 104 dmg and a vizel gold armor with king, and 
clown cards.

Second,  after I added my ele coins to my sword with sulfer, 
mercury, glow stones , chaos stones, etc... I had some left over sun 
and moon stones..any uses for these that could be helpfull?..

Also,  after washing my weapon i used 4 holy waters to produce the 
clerics, any advice on why the bumpkins that create the clown cards 
lower the weapons dmg instead of increasing it.. I thought the clown 
cards act as clerics ,when there used behind clerics...

Well, you can hang onto them and use them on a Bow for the Lunar Shot 
and Solar Flare Plunge Attacks --- or simply use them to raise Wisp 
and Shade, respectively, without creating a Wisp/Shade Card (though, 
this has limited uses, since they won't benefit from Wizard Cards).

Actually, Clown Cards (if you look at the Database) raise Sharp by 
50%, and lower Heavy by 50%.  Meanwhile, Cleric Cards lower Sharp by 
50%, and raise Heavy by 50%.
Thus, it depends on your weapon.  If you're using, say, a spear...
If you use 4 Holy Waters, you might find your attack power is WORSE 
than it was before!  This is because the highest value was reduced to 
very small (Sharp), and the lowest value was raised a little bit 
(Heavy, since it doesn't have much to start with).
Then, if you add 4 Bumpkins, the Attack Power would raise back up to 
normal, and then go up even more, since Sharp is then being raise and 
Heavy being lowered, when there is more Clown Cards than Cleric Cards.
Theoretically, have a Clown Card AND a Cleric Card should produce no 
change whatsoever in weapon stats, since they cancel each other out.  
However, since rounding is involved, it might end up being very 
slightly less or greater in some isolated situations.

Generally:
3x Cleric, Giant's Horn for Heavy.
3x Clown, Sharp Claw for Sharp.
3x Volcano, Scissors for Force.
And Poison Fang for Tech (;_; There's no +50% Tech Card!)

Actually, it's not missing.  It's under "Clown".

The Clown, King, Princess, and Wolf Cards all have no picture at 
all.  So, I didn't want to upload the picture multiple times for no 
reason.  [Also, the dummy Card "Horse" has no picture, either.]

Likewise, the Nymph of Orchards, Nymph of Dawn, and Sacrificed Nymph 
all have the same picture, and so I catalogued it under Nymph of Dawn.

Likewise, the Tower and Metropolis Cards both have the same picture, 
and so I catalogued it under Tower.

Likewise, the Spirit (of Shoes) and Spirit (of Mountain) have the 
same picture, catalogued under Spirit (of Shoes).

Likewise, the Spirit (of Housework), Spirit (of Ocean), and Spirit 
(of Forest) all have the same picture, catalogued under Spirit (of 
Ocean).

But actually, there IS a missing Card --- that card is Pixie (blue 
hat).  If you can get that picture, please tell me.  :) I'd like to 
complete my collection.

We'll all have a scheduled Group Chat session at some point, if I can 
arrange it.

If you'd like to join in on the chat, please post any times (days, 
etc.) when you are not able to be online within the next few days, 
and then I will post a message telling the actual date of the Group 
Chat Session, and then we'll be able to have a long chat session!
Be sure to post where you're at, Time-Zone-Wise, so I can schedule it 
appropriately!

:) Discussion will include tempering, and anything else, so long as I 
deem it ... appropriate...  And I'll aim to be on for the entire 
scheduled time (which will be a couple hours or so, so that people 
can come in later or earlier if they wish, and don't feel constrained 
to asking as many questions as possible in two minutes ; this is for 
MY sake).

There's only two ways to raise a weapon's attack power - Varnish 
(that is, change the material properties temporarily to improve the 
stats, by raising something that is large and lowering something that 
is small) and raise Essenses (that is, increase the attack power by 
changing the Growth Control Multiplier).

The Growth Control Multiplier is (GC + Essenses)/GC.  Thus, each 
Essense multiplies your attack power by 1/GC.

Thus, if you add essenses equal to your GC, your attack power should 
double from the original amount.
Since IshePlatinum Swords are from 30-50 power (I can't recall 
exactly; what are they really?), you'll need to add 18 Essenses to 
get it to 60-100, and 36 Essenses to get it to 120-200.

I realize ishplat swords kinda blow compared to all the other 
primary forging materials, but I enjoy the challenge of it...

Since IshePlatinum Swords are from 30-50 power (I can't recall 
exactly; what are they really?)

There 50 power base without tempering...

I looked over the marcus guide for tempering about twenty times, I 
think i'm finally getting the hang of it. "Finally"

I was wondering is it just a hopeless cause to try to build great 
ishplat items? (no future mode)

Also i'm having a bit of a probelm raising the essenses of wisp, and 
shade. Even with essenses eating each other. The guide says they're 
hard to raise anyway. Any advice on this?

Sonk: "lom newbie w/a cause" *my hands swore from typing and writing 
the database down on paper* strange enough I don't have a printer.

The quality of IshePlatinum isn't all that great, as it is topped in 
raw stats by LorimarIron and AltenaAlloy in the metals, and is topped 
in Growth Control by LorantSilver in the metals.  However, it's still 
easily possible to make strong (that is, 100+ attack power) weapons 
out of it.

Regarding Wisp and Shade.  You do realize that Wizard Cards lower the 
energy cost to raise certain Essenses, correct?  Well, since Wisp and 
Shade's Resistance is 7 on IshePlatinum, adding a single Wizard Card 
will reduce this Resistance to 3, while adding two or more Wizard 
Cards reduces it to 1.
The problem with Wisp and Shade, however, are that ONLY Wisp and 
Shade TPs that come from Wisp and Shade Cards that appear AFTER 
(chronologically speaking) the Wizard Card.

Thus, Wisp/Sorcerer/Sorcerer would count Wisp as being Resistance 1, 
while Sorcerer/Sorcerer/Wisp would count Wisp as being Resistance 7.  
That's a huge difference.  Note that TPs added by items are NOT given 
the benefit of Wizard Cards.  Thus, a Wisp/Shade TP can never be 
affected by three Wizard Cards, since the only way to do that would 
be to have four Cards at once (three Wizards, plus a Wisp/Shade Card).

Energy Cost for Resistance-1 to get to X level:
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512

Thus, it's possible to get to level 9 (256 energy) using a leaving 
Nymph of Dawn, and possible to get to level 7 (64 energy) using 
Cardless Tempering.
Add the following to a raw piece of IshePlatinum:
2 Mercury
1 Shade Silver [Shade 1
1 Glow Crystal [Shade 2
3 Meat [Shade 5 ; Meat give 16 energy
1 Electricity [Shade 6; Electricity gives 32 energy
1 Flaming Quill [Shade 7 ; Flaming Quill gives 64 energy
3 Glow Crystal
2 Mercury
1 Shade Silver
1 Card-Making Item [Shade 8 ; leaving Nymph of Dawn gives 192 energy
1 Gold Coin [Shade 9 ; any element except Wisp

Do the same if you'd like to raise Wisp, except replace Mercury with 
Sulpher, Shade with Wisp, and Wisp with Shade.

Considering money is easy to get, and armor doesn't have to be 
extensively tempered to have good defenses...  Try different 
materials.

Dragonscales (unbuyable, of course) makes the best physical defense 
armor (except Pierce Defense, which Adamantite and Fullmetal are 
better at -- but Dragonscales has the best other two phsyical 
defenses, and still very high Pierce Defense).

Adamantite makes the best magical defense armor.

So, your best bet is to wear a Dragonscales Armor (full armor), and 
then two Adamantite Rings or Pendants, with the effects/immunities 
you'd like.  The pendant should have all status immunities, and one 
of the two should have Salamander essense (the other two armors 
wouldn't; they'd have to have 0 for Bed of Thorn for boosted 
defense, though they might have a Heaven's Scale to allow healing 
still).

As i've said before this was the first time thru lom, and well i'm 
near the end of it now... the mana tree.

Anyone know of a website or maybe a screenshot of what the best 
placement of land would be.

best placement for produce. essenses. items.  ( for items does'nt 
the towns need to be further away from your house. ) (i'm off the 
ishplat kick, so i'm thinking more along the line of getting all my 
quest done. So, can someone give me a hand w/ this please... Or just 
point me to a link if possible..

Thx... "Sonk"...lom newbie w/a cause..

If I don't have Dragon Scales or Adamantite. What should I use then? 
I have DragonSkins and every buyable material. If possible, please 
include recipes to temper them. Thanks!

At www.gamefaqs.com there is a Map / Artifact Placement Guide, which 
answers your question completely.

Take any material you wish, and add the following:
1 Non-Spiny Seed
2 Needle(ttuce)
1 Springanana
1 Creepy Eye

That's about as good, defensively, as your piece of armor will get 
(except I'm making sure you'll be able to heal, by giving it the 
Heaven's Scale effect; beware, you won't revive if you die).

Use any material you wish.  Tempering armor is quick, easy, and 
done.  Unless you're making rings (and you want to add Special 
Effects or +20 bonuses) or Pendants (for Status Immunities).

There are two Cards under the "Beast" category: Unicorn and Phoenix.  
They are actually the "Beast God" Cards, but I don't think either are 
really Gods.

You might be thinking of the Evil God Card, "Beast-Headed God".

Albatross translated some of the Ultimania Charts for us here:
http://www.geocities.com/xo_pitseleh/lom.html

And also, www.gamefaqs.com has a helpful Tempering FAQ by MMajarra 
that has fairly accurate tables as far as items go.

i'm using ishplat2hsword for this test... well I have wisp-0 shade-0
Dryad-6 aura-5 salamander-5 gnome-6 jinn-6 undine-5...

for some reason I cannot raise aura salamander or undine past 5... 
or any essence past 6..

main question is i know you have to use ancient moon to raise the 
essense of aura when dryad is present... also with the 
sala,gnome,jinn,undine.

with the res of 7 7 8 8 8 8 8 8 on ishplat... can you get say aura 
to 5 while dryad is 6 than keep adding auras to add to the tp 
without the ancient moon being present than add it when the aura is 
at it's tp?

i've read over the tempering guides. i just wanted someone to point 
a few things out and explain how they work.

That is only true if wisp/shade aren't in balance. Since they're 
both zero aura/dryad should raise without interfering with each 
other. Ie. you don't need ancient moons at this point.

I'm not sure I understand exactly what you mean. But if you had 
shade>wisp then aura TP would drain dryad, so you would want to add 
the ancient moon first to prevent this from happening.

thx for that bit of info nano it helped a bit. took me up to 288 dmg 
on my sword. what i'm having a bit of trouble with is raising the 
essense past 6. as i said on the last message i had on that sword 
salamander-5 gnome-6 jinn-6 undine-5...i was having probs getting 
sala and undine along with aura past 5... but i beleave i'll figure 
it out sooner or later.

i'm now working on my first piece of altena and dior.

anyone have any really good recipes for altena swords?

O..How wrong was I to not try using yggdrasil w evil gods, and bed 
of thorns on armors sooner. Geez after that it makes finding items 
So much easier..and needless to say keeps me alive on no future mode

I'd reccomend not using altena for anything but flutes. DragonScale 
is better in everyway and theres an uber recipe for it on this site.

I was looking at the uberrecipes for dragonscales and dior wood..
well something crossed my mind as i was doing this.

15 and 16 mirror pieces for one item, is'nt there only a number of 
mirror pieces found each time you beat the game, say three or four?

so would'nt i have to beat the game say 10 or 12 times just to make 
two weapons from the dragon scales or dior wood. I know you need 
them for mirrored world... but I hav'nt actually grasped the full 
aspects of tempering with it anyway.

also what's the difference between using mirrored world and not 
using it does the essence level and dmg of the weapon differ that 
much?

~10% improvement over the max without using them.
You'd only need to beat the game 4 times to get 16 pieces.

But if you just want a functional weapon made fast use the quick 
recipe on dragonscale and you'll have more power than you need to 
finish the game easily.

On Dragonscales, without using Mirrored World at all, it's possible 
to get, at least:
15/15/15/15/12/9/12/9 = 102

I think...

I could write a recipe for that, if you really want >_> (please don't 
really want).

You won't be able to get to 15/15/15/14/9/15/9/15 = 107 without 
Mirrored World, as far as I know, since then you'll have to use Upper-
Row consumptions, and those will require Mirrored World utilized to 
drain the upper row in the right places at the right time..

I really enjoy posting messages almost as much as I enjoy playing 
lom, as you all can see ^_^

Well anyway I'll get to the point. Theres so many things and ways to 
temper cards, stats into items, etc. I've ran across lots of things. 
Like for the fact I cannot get yggdrasil or bed of thorns on a 
shield which really killed using shields for me. ( I'm not sure 
about that maybe I did it wrong.)

Well, I was going to ask if any newbie players of lom like me wanted 
to put some tempering recipes into the recipe book thats on the file 
list. Maybe then we could get the better, and more experenced 
players of lom to tell us what we was doing wrong, and maybe ways to 
improve what were doing.

I also play a few other games where people have played lom, and are 
discouraged from playing the game because of how complex the 
tempering items is.

( jc, any new news on the chat room, or am I the only one? Also i'm 
kinda interested in the none mirrored world recipe you spoke about 
in the last message. but I beleave it'll be a long recipe so i don't 
think i'll ask for it.) well this message is long enough so i'll 
stop yapping on and send ^_^

ok I bought myself a piece of lorimariron to test out my tempering 
skills.. well the outcome, NOT SO GOOD!!!.

I'll say this i'm having a bit of problem with the ancient moons 
cards. heres what I did.

I started out raising salamander, aura, and jinn to level 7 simple 
enough. now comes the part that stumped me. adding undine. I used 
chaos,undine gold, glow, glow,undine gold. that got me to Undine-5. 
now heres the part that got me confused a bit. after using that 
undine gold I added chaos, glow, undine gold, mercury, mercury.

But it did'nt take the gc up to 6. so Can someone Please give me a 
hand with this.. (I don't even want to get started on the mirrored 
world I think that one will take a while to figure out, even with 
the faq... they don't give a good example for ancient moon or 
mirrored world.

Thanks in Advance to who ever helps me out with my lil prob...

The Recipe Book is free for anyone to use, if they wish, so long as 
the results posted are correct (or close to being correct; there's 
some little problems with the Uberrecipes, but they're mostly 
fixable...).

As far as Bed of Thorn and Yggdrasil goes, remember a few things:
First, if Bed of Thorn isn't present, you have to make sure there's 
no World Cards present when you try to add Yggdrasil.  If there's an 
Ancient Moon, or Ragnarok, or any other World Card present when Bed 
of Thorn isn't, when you try to add Yggdrasil, it won't add anything.
Second, Yggdrasil requires 5 Dryad.  Make sure Dryad is at least 5.
Bed of Thorn requires that Dryad be at least 1, so it's not all that 
hard to add.  However, it requires that Salamander = 0, so you can't 
raise Salamander if you want to have Bed of Thorn present.
Does that help?

Well, adding:

Chaos Crystal
Glow Crystal
Undine Gold
Mercury <- This is when the Nymph of Dawn leaves!!
Mercury

What you want, is to have Ancient Moon present, AND two Witch Cards, 
AND Nymph of Dawn leaving, AND adding an Undine Gold.  Rather than 
having no Wizard Cards present with an Undine Card when the Nymph of 
Dawn leaves...

Let's see..
With Resistance 9/6/3/1...
Getting to level 6 requires 288/192/96/32 energy... so, really, 
that's going overboard.  You only need to have three Wizard Cards, 
Ancient Moon, and add an Undine TP that gives at least 32 energy.
So, do it like this:

Chaos Crystal
3 Mercury
1 Undine Silver

That should get you to level 6.  Now, to get it to level 7, you need 
576/384/192/64 energy.  So, really, it's going overboard to use Nymph 
of Dawn.  You only need to have three Wizard Cards, Ancient Moon, and 
add an Undine TP that gives at least 64 energy.
So, do it like this:

Chaos Crystal
3 Mercury
1 Undine Gold

That should get you to level 7.

My younger brothers playing lom atm. so i hav'nt had a chance to 
test this but can anyone tell me if wisp and shade can gain em is it 
gc or tp or ? i dunno. well can wisp and shade go in points without 
using the ancient moon.. send dryad and aura can when shade and wisp 
are a even point?

Thx for the info on the ancient moon i figured i was doing something 
wrong it really helped..

Well as soon as i can kick him off the game, i have 3 mirror pieces 
so i'm going to try to either get aura or dryad or one of the lower 
row essences past 7..

Anyone have any advice on this before I go testing it out?

TP = Tainting Point.  All Essense Cards, and some items (namely 
Coins), contain Tainting Points.  Each Tainting Point allows that 
essense to raise a singple point, provided there's enough energy to 
do so.  The energy required to raise to the next level is dependant 
on the level, the number of wizard cards, and the material's 
resistance.

Energy = All items contain energy, and you can also get energy from 
draining or from a leaving Nymph of Dawn Card.  You need energy to 
raise essenses to the next level.

GC = Growth Control.  This is only relevent when dealing with attack 
power.  This is the number that will determine how much each point of 
essenses will raise the overall attack power.  The lower the Growth 
Control the better.

Shade and Wisp are special.  Wisp can always raise - it never needs 
Ancient Moon to level up.  Shade, however, can not rise if Wisp is 
present.  Therefore, it is best to raise Shade up as high as you can 
go, and then raise Wisp afterwards.  Why?  Because if you raise Shade 
a little bit, and then raise Wisp, you can't raise Shade anymore.  
And, in addition, if Wisp>Shade at any point, Shade will drain to 0.

Dryad and Aura are also special, since their dominance depends on 
Shade and Wisp.  If Shade > Wisp, then Aura will drain Dyrad (and 
Dryad can't rise if Aura is present).  If Wisp > Shade, then Dryad 
will drain Aura (and Aura can't rise if Dryad is present).  If Shade 
= Wisp, then you can raise either Dryad or Aura, without any penalty 
whatsoever.

Does this help?

First i'd like to say Thanks for the info you peeps have given it 
has helped alot. ( jc & nano )

The information on the TP, ancient moon, witchs, sorc's, and nymph 
of dawn. Helped tons with my tempering.

Now i'd like to bother you all with a few more questions about 
tempering.

I've tried essence consuming, but alas the results have turned out 
bad yet again.

Ex: my LormarIron2hSword  essences are 7/7/7/7/7/7/7/7. now I wanted 
to test out the ordeal of essence consuming to raise the tp of other 
essences.

I started with dryad consuming aura, after about 10 tries I realized 
that this was going no where and also wisp was equal to shade, em 
maybe that had something to do with it. well after forgetting to 
save before I tried this and a waste of roughly 100,000 lucre.

I've decided to ask for a bit of help on this.

I guess after I realize how to temper correctly. 

I beleave i'll add a low essence recipe for ish plat and lomariron,
May 7 to all essence. That way the people alot like me will have 
something to go by when they are in normal and nightmare stages of 
the game.

I've come arcoss I nice little recipe for ishplat full armor, w +10 
all stats w 198 total def. i'll take a look at the total stats, and 
either email or post it to make sure I have it at its max stats and 
def.

Seems armors are the easiest thing for me.. Wonder Why `_^ !!!

Ok I noted earlier from a previous post that shade could not raise 
if wisp was present, also i asked was this the same even if ancient 
moon was present.. 

Well looking at the dragon scale recipe I noticed this.

0-0-0-0-9-0-0-0
0-0-0-9-9-0-0-0
0-0-9-9-9-0-0-0
0-1-9-10-8-0-0-1
0-1-10-9-9-0-0-0
0-1-8-11-9-0-0-0
1-1-9-10-11-0-0-0 <- I beleave wisp is in the recipe now
1-2-11-10-10-0-0-1<- mirror pieces my main prob is raising them w/it.

Is it possible to raise Wi Sh Dr Au Sa Gn Ji Un. without the use of 
mirrored world, or a min of mirrored world, Say 3 pieces ( which is 
all I have. ) 

If so would it be best to raise shade, aura and say undine with 
mirrored world first?

Under Mirrored World, Shade and Wisp dominance reverse.
So, Shade can always rise no matter what, and Wisp can't rise if 
Shade is present.  Also, if Shade > Wisp, and there's either a Wisp 
TP or a Shade TP present, Wisp will drain to 0.
Under Mirrored World, if Shade > Wisp then Dryad will drain Aura 
(rather than the other way around), and Aura won't be able to rise if 
Dryad is present.  If Wisp > Shade, Aura dominates Dryad.

You don't ever need Mirrored World, except to pull of some powerful 
draining techniques.  You can use Ancient Moon to raise things that 
are in conflict.
So, you can rase Shade->Aura->Wisp->Dryad->Salmander->Jinn without 
using anything special, since none of them conflict (so long as you 
don't raise Wisp higher than Shade).  Then you can raise Undine-
>Gnome with Ancient Moon.

That doesn't even use consumptions!  :)

Oh, you can also trade items to yourself using a third-party save, 
you know.  That way, you can save one file before tempering, and one 
after, and then trade the item from the one after to the Dummy Save, 
and then from the Dummy Save to your main file, and have a tempered 
item without using any Mirror Pieces whatsoever.

I just got my first piece of dragonscale, guess what as always, I 
made a 2h sword... This is what I did, and this is where my prob 
starts

I raised the essences to 0-0-6-7-0-6-0-6. ( I cannot remember how I 
raised aura to 7, thats whats bugging me.)

Note: ( I only want to raise the essences to 7 each.)
Note: ( I only have gold coins for Dryad, Sala, and Gnome.)
Note: ( for Wisp, Shade, and Undine. I only have 3 silver coins of 
each, also 10 sun, moon, and water crystals for the essences 
mentioned above.)(" I had probs getting wisp and shade but that'll 
be solved later.")

Ok, I want to raise wisp, shade, dryad, gnome, undine to 7. I tried 
different ways of doing so. But alas I kept failing to do so, and I 
cannot figure out why.

Ex: heres the steps i'm on atm.

[ undine ] <--invis slot
[ Undine ] <-- First
[ undine ] <-- second 
[ Gnome  ] <-- Third

Thx in advance... SonK "lod newbie w/a cause"

Dragonscale is resistance 7 on everything, so here's some energy 
costs:
7, 14, 28, 56, 112, 224, 448

Since you can't get 448 energy normally, you'll have to reduce the 
resistance with Wizard Cards.  Resistance 7 turns to 3/1/1.
3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192

You can get 192 energy just from a Nymph of Dawn leaving.  And, if 
you use two or three Wizard Cards.
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64

You can get 64 energy from many different items!

So, here's what you can do to raise something up to 7.

Wizard-Item
Wizard-Item
Coin
Any Card-Making Item
1 Gold Clover (or any other 64 energy cardless item)

Since that has two Wizard Cards, you only need 64 energy to get to 
7... And it goes to whichever element Coin you added, since that's 
where the TP goes.  This won't be what you use for Undine/Gnome, 
since they'll require Ancient Moon.  For them, you'd go:

Chaos Crystal
Wizard Item
Wizard Item
Coin
1 Gold Coin (of any essense)

Use a Gold Coin of an essense you've already raised, of course, or 
simply use a Gold Coin of the essense you're raising (and you can 
replace the first Coin with Any Card-Making Item if that's the 
case).  Since Gold Coins give 64 energy, and Chaos Crystal works the 
turn it leaves, you can use this to have two Wizard Cards present, 
while giving the energy to a TP that's on a Card.

When you're raising Wisp/Shade, make sure the Wizard Cards come on 
before the Essense card, or they won't be counted, making you require 
448 energy to get to the next level, again.

Thx for the info jc.

About five minutes after I wrote the last post it hit me on how to 
do it.

swords now 7-7-8-9-7-7-7-8 (ran out of glow crystals so I did'nt 
raise them anymore, rougly 556 dmg without giants horn atm. 

I was using for undine, dryad, aura,

from x-x-6-7-x-x-x-6 I did this Maybe I could of done it easier.

3X wizard cards
1 dryad gold  <--7
4x glow
2x wizard
1 dryad silver <--8
4x glow
2x wizard
1x aura silver <-9
4x glow
2x wizard
1x undine silver <--8 

could this of been done quicker and easier to get the same results? 
or better results? Plus I wanted to post a recipe for it.

heres my other question.

for bottom row essences say 0-0-0-0-8-7-8-7

I want to raise undine, and gnome past 7 can this be done without 
using mirrored world, while only using chaos/glow/wizard.

I hav'nt had the chance to test it out (money reasons).

But I know the wizard forces out 1 of the nymph of dawns. So I just 
had to ask before I go Thru it all again.

I wanted to check something real quick... as I posted above.

for bottom row essences say 0-0-0-0-8-7-8-7

I want to raise undine, and gnome past 7 can this be done without 
using mirrored world, while only using chaos/glow/wizard.

could if be possible to use , in 8 turns 7 wizard cards 1, chaos, 
than 1 of the undine or gnome coins to raise it to 8 |or| 9+  ?

To get the most energy, on Dragonscales, you have to have a Nymph of 
Dawn leaving, two Wizard Cards, and be adding a Gold Coin (or, for 
even more energy, a Glow Crystal, but you can't have any TPs if you 
need Ancient Moon on as well, so...).

So, to do so, you need to do the following:
4 Glow Crystal (so the next Wizard-items won't knock out the last 
Nymph of Dawn)
2 Wizard-items
1 Chaos Crystal
1 Gold Coin

Let's look at the energy requirements on resistance 7/3/1/1 with two 
Wizard Cards:
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512

Going from 7->8 requires 128 energy, which can be done using a Silver 
Coin.
Going from 8->9 requires 256 energy, which is exactly as much as a 
Leaving Nymph of Dawn (192) and a Gold Coin (64) give, total.  So you 
can get to 9, and no greater.
Going from 9->10 requires 512 energy... so even if you could have 
Nymph of Dawn leaving (192) and add a Glow Crystal (96), you would 
still not have enough energy (288 < 512).

So, 9 is the highest you can ever get without consumptions.

It's done by formula, really.  The resistance with another Wizard 
Card is:
Old Resistance divided by four, rounded down (or 1).
The result times three.

So, resistance 8 becomes 6, then 3, then 1.
Resistance 7, on the other hand, becomes 3, then 1, then 1.

Resistance 32 becomes 24, then 18, then 12.

The formlua for energy-required-at-level is:
Resistance * 2 ^ (Current Level)

MMajarra's charts assume that no energy requirement can go less than 
8.  This isn't true - you can drain less than eight energy, and it 
still raises some resistances and not others.  Resistance 6, going 
from 1 to 0, gives 6 energy.  It can raise another Resistance 6 from 
0 to 1, but it can't raise a Resistance 7 from 0 to 1.  If you had 
the right TPs, it could raise two Resistance 3's from 0 to 1...  :)

Well i've finally finished my newest sword, and well i'm quite 
impressed with it if I must say so. ( for a lod newbie at least )

essence 9-9-9-10-8-9-8-9

dragonscale final dmg 702.

well I beleave my next weapon will be one of the uberrecipes that 
you have posted on the group page. Maybe i'll try to see if I can 
make changes to it. Anyway after hours of searching i'm only found 4 
mirror pieces. 

So my question(s) are. Does anyone know where you can find all the 
mirror pieces playing one time thru the game?\

I found one piece in each of these locations Underworld
Madora Beach Bejeweled City Tree of Mana.
But in a previous post, I was told there was more than 4 mirror 
pieces found each time thru the game. Is this true ? Or will I have 
to play thru the game 4 times to make one weapon?

There are only four mirror pieces each runthrough.
They can be found:
Birdcage Lighthouse (Madora Beach)
The Underworld
Bejewelled City
The Mana Tree

I tempered a dior wood bow that has at least +10 on all essences and 
+9 on all attributes. it only has an attack power of 851 so it's kinda 
weak but I like it. If you would like to know how I made it just ask 
me and ill tell you. I'm no where near a pro, heck I haven't even seen 
all the wisdoms nor have I obtained all the artifacts, so I guess I'm 
just a good temperor and a nice person.
                        Peace be the journey,
                                       -Karuni-Kisyo-

I know how to temper Dior wood weapons with essences to 9, 10, 11, and 
even 12!  Because you are using Dior Wood you don't even need to use a 
single dryad coin! Now this meathod I think is the best that I've ever 
seen, but it cost if buying everything around 360,000 lucre. for this 
radical amount of money to make sence to anyone just think of buying 
85 glow crystals and 30 chaos crystals! if anyone is interested in 
learning this rather expensive meathod of tempering just ask and I'll 
post in the files section. Now, I've only tried this with a Bow and 
the spear and with the bow i got 815 attack and with the spear I got 
999! it took me about 20 hours to temper in all the items, with no 
misfires yet! 
 P.S. this is going out to help all newbies, namely Will Gatlin.

Feel free to post them!  Even if it isn't highly refined, it's still 
good to have- especially if it doesn't use Mirror Pieces.  :)

A "Card-Item" is simply any item that creates a Card.  Examples 
include Lilipods, Bumpkins, Loquat Shoes, Pear o'Heels, Hairball, and 
others.  When "Card-Item" is referred to in a recipe, it usually 
doesn't mean to use Coins or Crystals - these might interfere with 
what else is going on (although, they might not always).  It is also 
a bad idea to use Eyes or any other Pixie-creating items: Pixies are 
a pain to get rid of once they're on a piece of equipment.  If you 
want to be really sure, use Lilipods.  Lilipods creates the 
completely harmless Enticed Nymph and also provides little energy, so 
it can't really get in the way.

My best friend Miranda, who is famous for knowing everything there is 
to know about the Jumi, lives in Kentucky.

However, I do not.

Also, this is a reply to your previous message, asking me to email 
you to talk about games - what games do you intend to talk about?  
You do know that I'm usually on Yahoo Messenger from time to time, 
and on AIM as "Myst Erik Ery" quite often, right?

There is one in the weapon first walkthrough.
I haven't tried a 1h sword but it should end up somewhere around 300.

<I>Every time you add something, and the Yggdrasil Card remains on 
your item, you'll get [+1] to all of your stats.</I>

Ok, i've made many weapons while tempering and i know a bit about 
it, although i need to learn a few more tips still. I was browsing 
the files and in one the quote above was there. Does this mean i 
could add cardless items to gain +1 without bumping the Yggdrasil 
card off?

Lets say you have 4 mirror pieces, You need 16 for the Uber recipes, 
couldn't you have a third party save and you could use the junkyard 
to transfer over use the mirror pieces there then transfer back and 
rince and repeat...people use it to temper without using items so 
couldn't you do this with anything, ie glow crystals

Yes- if there's a Yggdrasil present (and no Dying Earth or Evil God 
Card - which will cancel out the +1 of the Yggdrasil Card), and you 
add a cardless item, each bonus will increase by [+1] up to the 
Limitation.  Since Yggdrasil's Limitations are -5~+10 (the highest 
other than a couple Heaven God Cards [which only do certain stats], 
the Evil God Cards, and Clown + Metropolis), you can increase your 
stats up to +10 all by simply adding a single Spiny Seed.

from there if you add another spiny seed and made the two 
yggdrasil's present could you then add more cardless items to get 
+20?

Yes; however, you can't transfer Mirror Pieces themselves.  Here's 
how it goes:
You have GAME A and GAME Z, which are both different games that have 
access to Prof. Bomb's Pawn Shop.  GAME A has Mirror Pieces and a 
tempering workshop.
Take GAME A and save it (let's call this new save GAME B).
Now, temper your item using the Mirror Pieces.  Put the item up for 
sale at Bomb's Pawn Shop.  Save over GAME A (but leave GAME B the way 
it was).
Now, load up GAME Z.  Go to the Pawn Shop and buy the item.  Now, 
sell it again.  Save over GAME Z if you don't mind the Lucre loss, 
otherwise, save as GAME Y.
Now, load up GAME B.  Buy the item from GAME Y/Z.  You now have an 
item that you tempered Mirror Pieces into, but still have all of the 
Mirror Pieces in your inventory.

There's no need to do this for items that are easily obtained, like 
Glow Crystals, but it's quite useful for Mirror Pieces.

After the last Piece is pushed in, the essence levels should be like this: 

Wisp 7: Shade7: Dryad 11: Aura 9: Salamander 11: Gnome 9: Jinn 12 : Undine 8

Next add two lilypods and then your plunge attacks and then add X spiny seed then your main power up cards. Example: Holy water for swords, or bumpkin for spears and bows, or ash for axes; you get the picture

On Dragonscales, at least, it's possible to get to=20
14/14/14/14/12/9/12/9 without the use of a single Mirror Piece.
And it's possible to get 9/9/9/9/9/9/9/9 without consumptions, too.=20=20

I suggest you look in the Recipe Book.
RECIPE #4 is a powerfully Magic-Defensive Pendant with all status 
immunities and all elemental resistances, and +20 all.
RECIPE #3 is a ring or gauntlet with +20 all.
And it's easy to make good Armor.  Take a hunk of Dragonscales, add 
the following:
1 Any Seed
2 Needle(ttuce)
1 Springanana
1 Creepy Eye / Dangerous Eye

Using the Springanana instead of the third Needlettuce makes it so 
you can regenerate HP.  You could also sacrifice defense for +20 all, 
but you'd only have a single Bed of Thorn then...

I'm a bow user. I basically used your method with the mirror pieces 
and my own method and I came out with a Dior wood bow like this...
20/20/19/19/12/20/14/20
and +9 all "extras" had medusa's arrow, pheonix falling and jump as 
plunge attacks. It can cause all stats, and it's raw attack is 999!
Thank you sooo much cause I never knew what the mirrored world card 
could do for me! I don't know how this will work with other things so 
I guess I'll just have to experiment on my own to find out how this 
works, but this did cost me around 800,000 lucre mainly be cause I 
messed up alot, though.

20, for an essense level?  That's impossible.  Entirely, completely 
impossible.
Even if you had infinite energy, you can only ever raise an essense 
to 15.  It's a half-byte per essense, leaving you with any number 
from 0 to F [15].
Bows can't 'cause all stats', either...

ahh well, I'm never using an off-brand cheating device again! The 
funny thing is my best frined's playstaion broke because of the same 
thing I did. I guess It will be a while till I play LoM again...I'll 
just use my next pay check to buy another one. Oh, one more thing, I'm 
sorry to all the gamers for my mistreatment to a great game like LoM, 
what I did was both wrong and stupid; don't follow my lead....

From what I know all of the cheat devices use 0-F(0-15)too, so how did 
my essence levels say 20 and 19? Was it something to the effect of the 
pokemon level modifier code? I'm confused and mad at myself, nobody 
wants to listen to the problems I made myself, so I'm a stop writing 
about them...

First i'd like to say that something terrible happened to me a few 
days ago. my playstation was struck by lighting during a 
thunderstorm near my home. so not only was the playstation ruined 
but the memmory cards were ruined, so I bought myself a new ps2 and 
started lom all over again.

Now knowing quite a bit more about the game than I did the first 
time around. I decided to contact a few of my friends who played the 
game a few years ago, and ask for a bit of info on a small project I 
wanted to do. This is how it turned out.

First i'd like to say this recipe started as the ubberrecipe found 
on this site, but we undertook it as a way to make the best weapon 
(no future mode) as we could the first time thru the game.

So basicly we cut it down to only 3 mirror pieces, but we ended up 
with a dragonscale 2h sword with 920 dmg 93 total essences (shade-9)
9 to all stats on the first time thru.

This recipe is a little less expensive than the recipe that Timothy 
Hughes posted. We only ended up using about 150,880 lucre.(btw tim 
thx for the info on the dior wood recipe. I might have to take you 
up on that offer, and see if I can cut down the price on making the 
dior wood items.) 

First the land placement is a must the first time around we used the 
land placement guide found on this site 
(http://db.gamefaqs.com/console/psx/file/legend_of_mana_map_a.txt)
*for the newbies like me or worse off than me, i'd recommend reading 
thru the entire guide on this site.* If you already know a bit about 
it scroll down to the Map A: Symmetry At Its Best section, that is 
the map we used. Its very important to using this for the essences 
coins + the forging items you'll need namely dragon scales.

If anyone has a better way of getting the coins + forging items in 
the first game ( dior wood, dragon scales altena alloy etc ).

I'll be either emailing the recipe to jc.Or posting it on the site 
after it's overlooked by a mod to see if it can be better made.

Thx... SonK   Ex-lom newbie w/a cause  ^_^

"Pokemon Level Modifier Code" actually would go up to 255 (FF), since 
Pokemon's levels can be anywhere from 0 to 255.  It's just that, in 
the game, there's a limit up to 100 - at that point, the program 
takes over and prevents it from going any higher.  If you have a 
Pokemon at level 101, you can level it up to 255, and then it will 
loop back around to level 0.
However, in LoM, the data for each essense can <i>only</i> be from 0 
to 15.  If you have another value there, then there's some kind of 
mistake.  Because there's only four bits allocated to each essense, 
and '1111' in binary is 15.

I've made a 100 essences dragonscale spear without mirror pieces.
15/15/14/14/12/9/12/9
Here are the key steps
wisp/shade/dryad/aura (is that the right order?)
0/14/14/0->0/15/13/1 
14/15/13/1->15/15/12/2

I think you need 5 mirror pieces to get 107
0/0/14/14
0/1/14/14->0/1/13/15
1/1/13/15->1/1/14/15
Then use a mirror to get rid of wisp, so shade will raise normally.
0/14/14/15->0/14/15/14->0/15/14/15
Use a mirror piece to raise shade to 15
14/15/14/15<=>14/15/15/14
Use three mirror pieces to raise two 12s to 15s on the bottom
14/15/14/15->15/15/15/14/(15/9/15/9)

Raising 14s is pretty straight forward, just a long and expensive 
consumption fest.

There are three ways to go with armor
1. Max armor- use three bed of thorns to get the highest possible 
armor values at the expense of not being able to regenerate.
dragonscale armor (seed, 3 needles, sleepy eye) 98/98/99/6
adamantite pendant (seed, 3 needles, creepy eye) 0/0/0/95
dragonscale ring 1/1/0/7

2. Practical armor- use two bed of thorns and a heaven's scale to 
get decent armor values while still being able to regenerate, but 
you lose the ability to revive.

3. Stat armor- use yddrasil and EGC to get +20 to all stats. With 
99hp you should regenerate at a fast enough rate to make up for your 
poor armor values. (and you have a 99defense/spirit stat) If you 
want high luck you're pretty much forced to go this way.

why not use hexy codes for figures on lom instead of binary etc. A 
few other games use hexy but squaresoft only adds exp, total 
stats,etc in hexy, (ff-9)(tetra master if anyone knows about it, the 
used hexy in it, even thou they screwed it up big time there. 0-E, 
but some use 0-f. I beleave gameshark goes by hexy codes anyway. so 
the max would be (255)-which would be ff in hexy, see what i'm 
saying?

Easy way to check binary~hexy decimal point systems if you don't 
know them. is using a sci calculator. (number)/decimal = 
(number/letter)/hexy decimal.

I don't use gamesharks period so i'm not sure what the starting 
codes for gameshark is anyway.

But I would think it would be (0-f=x)  x00-xxxx-xxxx not sure 
actually, but i think the first four (X) would be the actual code 
and the second four (X) would be the limits on the code ?

Plz tell me if i'm wrong

Maybe after that we could figure out your code, that way it does'nt 
waste your games ^_^

Computers never work in hex - they work in binary.  They work in 
bits and bytes.  One full byte, however, can go from 0 to 255.  
That's FF in hexadecimal, which is only two digits.  That's why 
people use it.
However, in LoM, the game only uses a half-byte to store each 
essense's data.  This, if 1F is stored in the byte (that's 31), then 
you're really going to get 1 in the first essense, and 15 in the 
second essense.
It's the same with + Bonuses.  Each Bonus has an internal, hex 
value.  From [0] to [15].  [4] means +0, [0] means -10, [14] means 
+15, and [15] means +20, with the other values being other bonus 
values.
However, there's eight values, and the game only stores their 
information in four bytes - each one only needs a half-byte.  So, if 
the value of that byte was 4E (78), the first stat would be [7] (or 
+3), and the second stat would be [14] (or +15).

There's no possible way to make them anything other than that, 
simply because that's how the game stores the data.

Gameshark uses hexidecimal.  300????? 00xx.
???? is the byte number that you want to change.
xx is what you want to change that byte to.

A code that starts with 500????? is a repeater code, and is just 
there so you don't have to enter a similar code over and over (like 
255 of each item, which would take a long time to enter if you had 
to do it for each item).

800????? xxyy is for changing two bytes at the same time, in the 
same way.  It simply changes the byte at ????? and ?????+1 into xx 
and yy, respectively.
I'm not sure what 801 means at the start of a code, but..

There's all the different magic types and combinations and such.  You 
should probably try "ControlFire" or "ControlLock".

Also, RandomFire is worse than RandomLock, as you are forced to sit 
there and wait while you could be doing other things if the Random 
targets are in the wrong places..

But I could only obtain 1 Tear because the underworld is placed right 
beside my home and even in no future mode the beast is at level 
49...so I'll just make copies!

 Yep, I double and even triple checked, and still the beast was at 
lvl 49! One way I remembered is because I forgot to equip a weapon, 
and I still beat it with my bare hands, now thats something to 
remember!!!

  Yep, I double and even triple checked, and still the beast was at

X is a variable.  "X Meat" means you put in any Meat (though, you 
might not want to use Magical Meat or Dragon Steak, as those are 
more rare and expensive than other Meats) until your stats are +20 
all.

Hey Everybody!

The guy who runs this place was nice enough to let me upload my first
recipe ever. It's not complete, as I haven't really tackled varnishing
yet. But as far as raising essence levels go, I think it's a fine
first attempt. I mean, it is 88 essence levels, after all. If only
Lorant Silver had a lower resistance to Wisp (say 7, for instance,
instead of 8), I could've gotten a nice round total of 90 essences...
Ah, well. Maybe I'm missing something...

Anyway, if anybody has anything to say about it, please feel free to
share it with me. I'm actually hoping for some comments that will help
me improve the recipe, or possibly shed some light on something new
which I don't even know about.

Well, I hope it helps someone. I tried to make it easy to follow and
instructional for those who, like me, are rather new to tempering. I
don't know how to do the math to figure out the strength of the
various weapons that this recipe would make, but my honest estimate is
that it should just about break an attack power of 400, or so, with
the right varnish.

Now I'm going to sleep. I've got work tonight... XP

Why do you raise Undine first?  It'd make more sense to simply raise 
Salamander up, and trigger Salamander consumptions with Undine to 
raise up the upper-row essenses, without having to use Chaos 
Cyrstals.
You'd have to aim it so that there's no energy left, of course, 
because otherwise, Undine will raise a point as well... And that's 
not good.
^_^;
It's just that there's cardless items with Undine TPs, so you can 
drain Salamander once, without using a Chaos Crystal after every 
time you drain it.
Of course, if Undine raises above 0, you'll have to use a Chaos 
Crystal to raise Salamander back up, but that's still one less Chaos 
Crystal than before...
And if you can get Salamander to 9 every time, instead (which would 
require Undine to be at 0, rather than above 0, or it would require 
you to drain Sala to 0 every time you drain it, then drain Undine 
using Jinn, then drain Jinn using Gnome, and then raise Salamander 
while draining away all of the Gnome... which would take forever and 
use a lot more Glow Crystals than before).

I don't see why you can't use the same method you were using before 
to raise Wisp up to 12 as well.. Wouldn't it be possible to get 
12/12/12/12/9/12/9/12 that way, to get 90 total essenses?  :) Not a 
lot better, but still...
And you can get 14/14/14/14 on the upper row, I believe, by raising 
Salamander to 12 (with Gnome consumptions) and draining that instead 
of draining it from 9.  ^___^

*shrugs*

Well, I never thought of any of these things... I am
rather new to tempering (with my own recipies and
whatnot), and it never occurred to me.

I did things the way that I did them because I thought
that if I drained an Essence that uses Sulpher to raise
an Essence that also uses Sulpher (Sala to raise Wisp,
for instance) that I wouldn't release all the energy
that I possibly could. So if there are 2 Sorceror cards
and a Wisp card present when I add in an Undine TP,
I'll only really be draining 64 energy in a Level 7
Sala Consumption, instead of 448. Am I wrong in my
presumptions... If I am wrong, then I guess that I
could re-write the whole thing from scratch...
Actually, I could definitely get Shade, Dryad, and Aura
all the way to 14!!! It would also raise overall costs
to over 1,000,000 Lucre if I just modified the current
recipe... OUCH! I don't like the thought of spending
the next two weeks fighting for Wind caps and Clear
Feathers. I think an entirely new recipe based on what
I've learned is a better idea.

But back to your question regarding Wisp, I couldn't
figure out HOW to raise Wisp above Level 10 on
LorantSilver because I would need a total 3072 energy
to do so. As I previously understood it, I could only
have 2 Sorceror cards for Wisp and Shade that actually
count for their respective Tainting Points. And
LorantSilver has a Resistance of 8 to Wisp, 6 to Shade,
and 7 to everything else. This means that I would've
had to somehow make 3 Sorceror cards available to the
Wisp TP to lower the energy requirement down to 1024.
I already know that I cannot do this because I had
already tried to use 3 Sorceror cards to raise Wisp to
Level 8 without draining essences.

4 Glow Crystal
3 Sulpher
1 Wisp Silver/Gold 236/256 = NOTHING : ONLY NEEDED 128

Anyway, I didn't see what I could possibly drain to
get that kind of energy. The most that I could come up
with was 2048. However, I think that I understand how
to harness 14336 energy now. I also see that I could
have made a tempering scheme that was
13-14-14-14-9-12-9-12 by draining either Undine or
Gnome after getting them to Level 12 to fill the top
essences. 97 Essences, instead of 88! If only I had
better understood this stuff yesterday... ;_;

But, again, Wisp will still fall behind due to the
requirement for a third (active) Sorceror card because
of the High Resistance to Wisp. Or am I missing
something else, which is highly probable?

hey everyone, i've been looking for a haven like this for the longest 
time. in any case, i've come across an altena alloy 2H sword and 
using existing tempering methods i can't seem to raise it's strength 
above 357.  i have a lorimar iron 2H sword at 396, so my question is, 
is there a recipe that will raise the altena alloy 2H sword above 
357? any help on this is greatly appreciated. thanks

I'm fairly certain you can get, at the least 14/14/14/14/12/9/12/9 
on AltenaAlloy, totalling 98 Essenses... And if not 9 on those two, 
than at least 7.  Which would mean 96 Essenses.

How much have you got on yours, total?  If it's less than 90, then 
yes, it's certainly possible to raise your attack power a little 
higher :)

Swords are difficult, because they are so balanced, and making them 
out of metal doesn't help, either.

Highest you can get (as far as I know/made) is

15/15/14/14/15/7/15/7 (102 Essenses)

For Altena Alloy

Heya's all

I added an AltenaFelt Recipe (Fabric Weapons of Doom) to get to 106 
total essenses.  While I'm not the best with efficiency, I look 
forward in getting the recipe torn apart by the best :)

Ideal weapons that can be made from the material would be

Spear
Dagger
2handSword
2handAxe
1handSword

And I also listed the attack powers after varnish in the recipe as 
well.

first off, check out the pet guides on www.gamefaqs.com there's a 
guide there to maxing out your pets, and it has a table showing seed 
combinations and the % chance of getting what you want. 

and, as it says in the faq, don't worry about growing the playing 
card suite produce; basil, dialaurel, clover and mint, since you can 
buy those relatively cheap at the bone fortress. (but you'll have 
more mint than you know what to do with anyway) and secondly, don't 
worry about growing toadstoolsheds unless it's for tempering, because 
as the guide says, they're nearly useless for pets. 

and since i'm here i might as well say IIRC either big/round or 
big/oblong (can't recall exactly which) seems to get pine o'clock 
often.

also, i thought that i'd say a big hello to the group-at-large, 
having joined just recently. i finally have my own copy of LOM and 
have been giving it and the library printers a good workout. i'm 
trying to learn some tempering now, before i actually get started 
muffing it up, like i did the first time i extensively played mana a 
few years ago... :hangs head and shudders in retrospect:

anyhow, this looks like a good place to continue my quest for 
knowledge, and i'll be looking forward to the experience. 

toodles,
Shaboo

why i cant varnish my weapon? If scissors raise force 50%, then if i add 4 scissors to 2h lorimar iron axe, its attack power should increase from 56 to around 300 (!!!). But what i get is only 64 after 4 scissors.
And also, in cardless item that can increase weapon property--like gold clover--,is the effect last forever? Thanks

You can only varnish with one item - basically, your weapon damage 
is determined by five things:

Base Damage (this is affected by the Element Total you have, as well 
as the materal and weapon type).

Card Slot 1
Card Slot 2
Card Slot 3
Last Item Tempered

If you want to raise Force, add three Volcano Cards (from Ash), and 
THEN add a Scissors at the end.  You'll see the raise to 300 attack 
about that time.

Cardless tempering simply uses the energy of Cardless Items (like 
Gold Clover) to raise essense levels.  Since essense levels are 
permanent until you drain them (and sometimes, it's impossible to 
drain certain essenses after you raise others), yes - cardless 
tempering effects are permanent..

Hi, folks! I'm new to the list, but not to LoM. I've only just gotten into some serious 
tempering, so I have a question or two.

I recall reading on GameFaqs (and I could be wrong) that you don't need to pump 
essences into armor after you get the essence marker, because it wouldn't add more 
resistance. Is that true? Or does the level of essence actually affect the amount of 
resistance?

Thanks much!

There's been no hard testing to prove it either way, but, as far as 
I know, ONLY the Essense Marker determines elemental resistance.

The only reason to raise essenses on armor past the Essense Marker 
is for either looks, or to get specific Mystic Cards.

I suggest you duplicate it.

If you don't know how, then it's probably best you didn't.  I would 
make a Dragonscale Staff, Flail, or Glove, since DiorWood makes 
everything else better anyway.

thanks, i'll look into that, how sad that dragonscale
and altaena alloy are the strongest materials i've
come across after five months of game play... perhaps
i'll go back to the FF series....

Hey all, just thought I'd put down the essence path to 105 total 
essences on Diorwood for your lookover.

I did of course leave out certain parts, but ya'll should get the

Elemental Essences don't work for armor the way they do for a weapon. 
The only reason to pump the essense levels is to get an element 
resistance flag, or to meet requirements for a cool card that you 
want.




As for Michael Illuminate... 


You ONLY got Dragon scales and Altena Alloy? Those materials are 
nothing to sneeze at. And unless you are actually going out of your 
way to hunt materials, the fact of the matter is, you won't get them. 
Don't be so discouraged!

well thanks i'll keep that in mind... i guess it's
just a matter of patience, joints and lots of food
near by... and duh.. i just found out that the
Polterbox's syncro helps get rare items so that might
help my plight... in any case i also need a good
recipe for armor since all of my armor tempering went
to my golem... thanks a lot guys!

Normally, people just add Bed of Thorn (x3) to their armor, and cap 
with an item.
Of course, that will prevent you from regenerating HP.

Adding Elemental Resistance markers and Status Immunities can be 
useful as well, along with adding certain (not "No HP Regeneration") 
Effects.

Dragonscales is the best physical-defense armor material, while 
Adamantine is the best available magic-defense armor material.

Ash can only be found in treasure chests, and these locations are:
Madora Beach
Bone Fortress
White Forest

I hope this helps.

 in the following one, something seems wrong already, no dryad, wisp. 
I have done exactly what it shows, except I made a few differences. I 
know some items have more elements to certain ones as Dior wood to 
dryad. Now I know you can have Wisp and Dryad, just has to be lower 
than there counter parts right? I find it odd, to say Toadstoolshead 
as replacement, for Dragon blood, doesn't Toadstoolshead have a Shade 
defense of +1 ?

I made that recipe to be energy-effective.  What happened was Shade 
became much higher than Wisp, causing you to be unable to raise 
Dryad any more due to it being in conflict.  Because of this, a few 
things happened.  First, Yggdrasil was not created.  You NEED 
Yggdrasil in order to raise stats to +20, since it gives +1 to all 
stats, without it, you're just going to lose stats.  Second, Wings 
of Darkness was created from the Blackened Bat due to you having 5 
Shade and 0 Wisp.  This is bad, because you don't want it.  Since 
you had Wings of Darkness around, the Sacrificed Nymph at the end is 
never allowed on the equipment -- it sacrifices itself for the Evil 
God.  Thus, you don't have the Petrification Immunity.  It also 
complicates other things, and adds another -1 to your equipment, 
making it even worse than just losing out on Yggdrasil.
Because Undine was only raised to 2 (I am not sure why Wisp didn't 
rise, but it's because of the energy being used differently than I 
intended, I think), the Squalphin did not create the Ocean God Card, 
so that's why you don't have Flameburst Immunity.

I would suggest you follow the recipe, using a jewel (Emerald, 
Pearl, Lapis Lazuli).  Since these also have Resistance 8 (as does 
MenosBronze, FullMetal, and some others), they will work just right.

Toadstoolshed at the end will work because adding shade TPs at that 
point won't change anything - as you should have Wisp, and have 
shade too high to raise with just a Toadstoolshed.  You can only use 
Dragon's Blood if Salamander is at 1 or 2.

If you'd like to adapt it to your own recipe, feel free.  Remember 
that you need to have 1 point in an essense to get its Resistance.
You will need the following:
1 Shade, 1 Wisp, 1 Aura, 5 Dryad, 1 Sala, 1 Gnome, 1 Jinn, 3 Undine
Shade cannot be 5 or more.

If you get those essenses, it should work out just fine.
Start with Shade and Aura, then raise Wisp to Shade's level (careful 
not to go over) and then Dryad up to 5.  Then raise Undine and 
Gnome, and then Sala and Jinn with Ancient Moon.

Hope I helped :)

shouldnt it be a full one!? no offense. I am not good on math or 
remembering everything of it.  as what each card does for every 
spacific attribute, to weapons armors gloves hats ect. it has and how 
certain items effects only work at certain elemental levels, and how 
you have to use reverse witch/sorccer  mirrored for certain situations

can you say the whole recipt, I have looked at ones pasted long ago, 
for a full one, and they never worked wright, I was always out of 2  
immunties and one or more  essances. and either all - 15 or only hp 
+15

peze help!........ as you had it, 20 to all lucre gain, no bed of 
thorn, IF it can be missed. I hate that card, cheap.

Try the QuickRecipe, or try raising essenses yourself and capping 
appropriately.

Since a pendant only needs 1 in an essense to get a marker, I went 
over and beyond that and raised everything to 3 except Dryad (needed 
at 5) and Sala (needed at 2). That's because I already had a working 
recipe to get all essenses to 3 on All-8 Resistances.

This recipe will work on any Resistance-8 material, including 
Adamantine, MenosBronze, Pearl, Lapis Lazuli, and Emerald..
Don't replace the Silver with Gold.  Follow the recipe, and it 
should work just fine.  I used this recipe to make Yaynomicon, my 
+20 All, All Immunity, All Resistances, Extra Lucre, +25% Magic 
Defense pendant.

That should work.  I do not see a reason why it shouldn't, if you

 or ime not understanding something. 


 in your area that I have marked + the Sulpher why that, because, it 
will NOT raise Dryad. I had to sub. 2 spiny seeds, and it only raised 
it by +1 meaning only going up to +4 on Dryad.  The Wicked eye why, 
it wont again raise Dryad up, and I have tried the Gold Dryad card 
Sulpher lilpods method and the like, that wont raise past 4 still.  I 
also want to note, that the Toadstoolshead and dragon blood does 
matter, because I used Toadstoolshead, and my stats, +15 to strength 
and spirit, but the rest where all - 15, but when I used dragon 
blood, my spirit, only spirit started going to -5 and then enough 
went up to +5.  Even it being messed up. I was still able, once, to 
get all status defenses, but still - 10

What material are you using, and have you been following the recipe 
exactly so far?  Your recipe seemed to have been using a lot of Gold 
Coins, which are detrimental in this case.

>  in your area that I have marked + the Sulpher why that, because, 
it 
> will NOT raise Dryad. 

(Sala)
Spirit (of Forest)
Jinn
Ancient Moon

These are the Mystic Cards after you add the Sala Silver.
Adding a Moth Wing at this time gives enough energy for Sala to 
raise to 2, but not enough for Jinn to raise to 4.

(Spirit [of Forest])
Sala
Spirit (of Forest)
Jinn

Adding any Seed will raise Dryad by 1, making the Mystic Cards as 
follows.  Note that none of the energy can go to Sala, since it's in 
Conflict (Undine is present)

(Dryad)
Spirit (of Forest)
Sala
Spirit (of Forest)

Sulpher provides 24 energy.  Adding Sulpher will raise Dryad by 1 in 
this case, since on Resistance 8, it requires 16 energy to get to 
Level 2.  Now Dryad is at 2.

(Sorcerer)
Dryad
Spirit (of Forest)
Sala

Sulpher, again, provides 24 energy.  Since there will be Card 
Movement, and there'll be a Sorcerer present, Dryad's Resistance is 
no longer 8.  It's now 6.  It requires exactly 24 energy to raise 
Dryad to level 3 now (6 * 2^(3-1)).

(Sorcerer)
Sorcerer
Dryad
Spirit (of Forest)

Lilipods does not have enough energy to raise Dryad, but it does 
change the cards:

(Enticed Nymph)
Sorcerer
Sorcerer
Dryad

Now, when we add two Wicked Eye, the Cards do not change.  Wicked 
Eye provides 48 energy.  Dryad, to raise to 4, requires even less 
energy than before - TWO Wizard Cards reduces the resistance 
further, from 8 to 6 to 3.  Now, it requires (3 * 2^(4-1)) = 24 
energy to raise to level 4.  That's fine!  We have 48.  Then, we add 
the second Wicked Eye.  It requires (3 * 2^(5-1)) = 48 energy to 
raise to level 5.  What do you know?  You have 48 energy!  Dryad 
raises to 5.


If Dryad isn't raising, it's because it is in Conflict - ensure that 
Shade is not higher than Wisp.

In addition, it does NOT matter whether you use Toadstoolshed or 
Dragon's Blood.  They both do the exact same thing, except that 
Toadstoolshed provide an additional Shade TP, and Dragon's Blood 
creates a Mystic Card when Salamander is 3 or more.
The reason you're getting strange endings is because you don't have 
Yggdrasil present.  You had two Evil Gods present, so you're going 
to end up with everything at -10 except for Power and Spirit (at 
+15, due to the Bonus Limitations of the two Evil God Cards).

Dryad was the only essance that was not right, sala, undine was right 
as the others. I will try again, even tho I did this 4 times already.
I tried to do this on althena, Ishe alloy or like that, didn't work, 
they seem to have aura and another resistance I cant recall now. Wisp 
was nit higher than shade, all the elemnts the same(3), except dryad, 
at 4

I've used the recipe twice and never had a problem with it.

The two situations which I could see going wrong with what you're 
doing.

1.  Shade > Wisp and thus Dryad can't rise (though it would not of 
risen to 1 if this were the case)

2.  in the Any Seed part, you're adding a Spiny Seed which is a NO 
NO.  Add any other seed OTHER than Spiny (to get the dryad card).

If you're doing either of these, Dryad won't rise when you add in 
the Sulpher and Wicked Eyes.

If neither of the cases are happening, then you're not telling us 
something we need to know to help you :p

PS

Dragon Blood and Toadstoolsheds do the exact same thing assuming 
Sala < 3

Get AltenaFelt (lvl 4 material shop), then follow the Quick Recipe

minutes.

This is wrong. Even if you used a spiny seed the sulpher should 
still push on a sorcerer. The only way it wouldn't is if you're 
using dummy items from a gameshark. Dummy items aren't 
labeled "Secondary Item (Bottle)" or whatever. The real item is the 
last one of the duplicates.

 the fake sulpher,  but I found the real one out of the fakes, but 
later I had a problem where I got 2 pixies, yellow and blue, then I 
just used 3 holy waters to remove them, then at some point, my freeze 
status defense, went gone, but my sala is 2 and undine 3, I tried 
re-putting I tack, and, the card did show up, as placeing it's self 
on, but, the effect still not show up. 
I did a bit different to that getting the dryad up to 5, and was only 
able to get all stats to 10+  all elemental defenses of 3, except 
dryad at 5 and sala at 2, all status defenses except freeze. ;-/

In my newer recipes, you'll notice I say 'Non-Spiny Seed' instead.

I really didn't expect anyone would use a Spiny Seed in that place, 
when the other seeds are FAR more common, and still fit into 
the 'any seed' place.
Just as I assume people won't use Dragon Steak for 'Meat' (they can, 
as it makes no difference... but, why?  Why, when you can use Odd 
Meat?).

But, in any case, anyone who knows how tempering works can tell that 
Spiny Seeds are different from the other Seeds.
All seeds do the same thing, in tempering - provide a little energy 
and create a Dryad Card.  The exception is the Spiny Seed.  This 
creates the Yggdrasil Card.  Because of this, it can't be used when 
you need a Dryad Card.
Many of the 'any seed' spots can be replaced with Dryad Gold or 
Dryad Silver, as well.

Dryad Cards are produced by so many things, they're the most common 
Card!  Small Seed, Long Seed, Big Seed, Round Seed, Oblong Seed, 
Crooked Seed, Flat Seed, Dryad Silver, Dryad Gold, and all cardless 
items on a wooden equipment produce Dryad Cards.
No other Card boasts that many different producers, even if you 
discount the effects that wood brings...

:P

It's like me putting 'Card-Item' in, and having people ask where to 
get a Card-Item.  >_>;;;

"seriously"-Selphie T.

 in makeing a shoe, for good stats, and extra exp effect.... I have a 
q. One I found.
Oak wood shoes( am guessing because it is tree, dryad relation right?)

1 Round seed 
3 Sulpher
1 Round seed
1 Needlelettuce
1 loquat shoes
1 Spiny  seed
1 Poison fang
1 Spiny seed
10 Grave Dirt/Creey Eye

grave dirt is easer to get, Ithink, than Creepy Eyes. The Question 
is, might sound noobies, but I am to this. I tried it, and the Gnome 
spirit, of laquat shoes, leves, is the effect still in, of the hidden 
spot?

Could I change the Oak Wood for something else, like Ishe Plantinum? 
or  does it have to be tree baised (Dryad) or if it can't, then I 
have to put more points to Dryad?

For that particular recipe, the Grave Dirt _must_ be used - the 
Creepy Eye comes last.

Here is a recipe that should work on most non-wood materials (like 
Ishe Platinum):
1 Round seed 
3 Sulpher
1 Round seed
1 Needlelettuce
1 loquat shoes
1 Spiny seed
1 Poison fang
1 Spiny seed
1 Grave Dirt
X Meat
1 Creey Eye

You could have used the same recipe, and it would still have worked, 
though - the only difference in the two is the Dryad Cards that 
would have been made by the meats in the Wooden Item.  Since we 
don't want those when we're Bonus Raising (at the end), we have to 
use World-Card Creating Items.  Since these _technically_ create a 
Card, they don't make Dryad Cards, but then don't push anything in, 
either.  Which is what we want - to stall.  That way, nothing 
happens except that the bonuses go up and up!

The Spirit (of Shoes) Card adds the Extra Experience Effect as soon 
as it appears, and the Extra Experience Effect remains for as long 
as there is no other Effect added.
The first Effect added was the No HP Regeneration Effect, from the 
Bed of Thorn.  Then, the Spirit (of Shoes) Card removed this Effect, 
and added the Extra Exp Effect.  Since there's no other Effect-
making item in the recipe, the final result is that it has the Extra 
Exp Effect.

Does this answer your questions? :)

Sincerely,
JC "Myst Erik Ery" D

Each piece of armor will only have one effect. The last one added 
will cancel any previous ones.
Heaven scales prevents reviving and therefor makes the effects which 
speed reviving useless. Bed of thorns prevents hp regen so the 
effects which allow you to regen while moving are wasted. But I 
don't think any of the others interfer with each other.

chaos crystal
sala silver
sulpher
sulpher ______acid
spiny seed

Sala is highly resistant so with ancient moon, sala, sorcerer 
showing it can only get to 4. But since the ancient moon effect is 
active even when it gets pushed off I can have one turn with sala 
and two sorcerers. This and the energy from the spiny seed is enough 
to get to 5, for a total of 50.

Something's wrong with this statement.  Just yesterday I made a ring 
with Fertility Goddess, Spirit of Housework, and Unicorn in that 
order, and my Fertility Goddess still lets me share xp.  I believe I 
am also getting the extra lucre and faster recover effects.  So the 
second statement is definitely wrong (I added Fertility Goddess 
before the others), and possibly the first as well (although I admit 
I might be hallucinating the benefits).

You can't have been reviving faster - Unicorn requires that you have 
Spring as well, to get the Effect.
However, you're sure you were sharing experience?
And you're sure it was the Spirit (of Housework) you added, and not 
a different one?
Hmm...
You also could have been wearing another Ring with the Share-Exp 
Effect.  You can have more than one operative Effect, since you can 
wear three pieces of armor, but can only have one Effect on each 
armor piece.

Sincerely,
JC

Not according to Majarra's (outdated) Faq, which is why I put it on 
the ring in the first place.  It was what I was going by.

I am currently equipped with an IshePlatinum Armor (conveniently 
named IsheMail), a LorimarIron Mantle, and The Ring in Question, 
which is Emerald.

Neither the armor nor mantle have been tempered in any way.

After I got Dryad, Gnome, and Undine up to 3 each on the ring, I 
added
lillipods
lillipods
lillipods
lillipods (I'm a paranoid little fella)
Ear of Wheat
Hairball
Whalamato
Moth Wing.

After this my cards were Fertility Goddess, Spirit, and Unicorn.

I'm new at this, so I need to trust the faq that the Spirit was 
indeed a Spirit of housework.

I am most definitely sharing XP.  How can I go about confirming (or 
disproving) Lucre gain?  (That is, how exactly is lucre gain 
implemented?)  If this is really that sensational, I'll do it.

Kill the golem at bejeweled city with and without the ring. See if 
you get different amounts of money.

Um... it'll be a few days before I reach that point in the game.  I 
only play an hour a day or so.  But I'll do it.

Is there anywhere I can go to read up on all the latest advances in 
Tempering knowledge?  I'm limited to what's in Marcus Majarra's FAQ, 
and you guys are talking stuff that doesn't jibe with it.

For example, there seems to be a new theory of tempering stat 
bonuses floating around...

Information on immunity applications would be nice, too.  I tried to 
make a pendant with all immunities once, and it backfired -- stuff 
kept going on and off.  I'm not interested in how its done (I can 
read the recipes) I'm interested in why it works for your recipe and 
not mine.

Not that I remember what my recipe was.  It was years ago.

> Information on immunity applications would be nice, too.

This is the basic recipe I use

Stinky Breath <- (black pixie) <- Confusion/Poison
fire stone
sulpher
sulpher
holy water
Zombie Claw <-- Paralysis
Blackened Bat <-- Darkness
Ghost Howl <- Sacrificed Nymph <- Petrification
Sharp Claw <- God of Destruction <- Freeze (sala 5+, undine 0)
water stone
Fishy Fruit <- Spring <- Sleep
Squalphin <- Ocean God <- Fireburn (undine 3+, total 5+)
Holy water

The stinky breath comes first because it will negate any other 
immunities that come before it. The only two cards with essence 
requirements are God of Destruction and Ocean God. I raise the sala 
before the undine to avoid conflicts. The first holy water pushes 
off the pixie. The Zombie Claw and Blackened Bat are used for their 
energy to raise sala to 5. I use the Ghosts Howl before the Sharp 
Claw so that the Sacrificed Nymph is sure to show up instead of 
pushing around the EGC (evil god card). After the Sharp Claw is on I 
start raising undine while consuming sala. The Fishy Fruit and 
Squalphin both have undine TP so sala is 0 by the end of the 
tempering. The last holy water just pushes on the Ocean God and it 
can be replaced by almost any other carded item.

When most enemies drop experience crystals and lucre coins, they 
drop a set amount of crystals and coins.  There are sometimes two 
levels of these drops, since Crystals and Coins are the "level 1" 
and "level 2" drops of most creatures (and are removed from possible 
item drops when you have a Polterbox in Synchro).
Chess Knights are the exception, with their level 3 drop being 
Crystals and Coins.

Basically, here's what you do:
Kill something with the ring.  Count the Coins (or coint the couns, 
whatever.. >_> Hehe, don't ask) that are dropped.
Kill the same thing without the ring.  Count the Coins again.

If you get one more coin with the ring, the Extra Lucre is working.  
Otherwise, the Extra Lucre likely isn't working.

You might want to try it a couple times, in case the enemies drop a 
different amount of lucre sometimes, in addition to how much they 
normally drop (that is, their level 1 item drop might be 3 coins, 
while their level 2 item drop might be 5 coins).

I hope this helps.

There are three Plunge Attacks:
Uppercut: Down+Toward + Power Attack
Jump: Away, Toward + Power Attack
Thrust: Toward, Toward + Power Attack

For the bow, Uppercut is replaced with 'Shot', and Thrust is 
replaced with 'DoubleShot'.

Any special Plunge Attacks you add replace one of the existing 
three, and are performed exactly the same way.  Their graphics will 
be the same, and won't change.  You might see the result of the 
effect, though (status, such as Flameburst, or a 'MAG DOWN' message).

Is that arbitrary, or is there some quality of Stinky Breath that I 
can look for in other objects to see if they will negate immunities 
as well?

First thing to remember is that I was trying this after over a year 
away from even thinking about tempering, so I was doing some 
theoretically silly things...

I think my full recipe was as follows:

Emerald Ring.  (Named it TalasCore -- I have a Jumi fetish)

Long Seed
Long Seed
Honey Onion
--Leave forge to check Dryad 3
3-4 Lilipods (I forget how many exactly)
EarthStone
Sulpher
EarthStone
--Leave forge to check Gnome 3
3-4 Lilipods
WaterStone
Mercury
WaterStone
--Leave forge to check Undine 3
3-4 Lilipods 
Ear of Wheat
Hairball
Whalamato
Moth Wing

And I definitely, positively get XP sharing.

The quality to look for is that they remove immunities.
I know pine oclock, rhinolaupe, and stinky breath do this, but there 
might be more.

Here is a list of monsters which normally don't drop coins.
So if you fight them and they drop coins the effect is working or 
the Brady guide is messed up. =_=

In the LoM Forgecode, there are two ways to change immunities.
One is:
Immunity = Immunity OR Petrification
This means that you'll get Petrification Immunity in addition to the 
Immunities you already have, but only if you don't have 
Petrification Immunity alread.
Immunity = Petrification
This means that you'll get Petrification Immunity, and ALL OTHER 
IMMUNITIES will be nulled, because you're setting it to ONLY be 
Petrification Immunity.

It is this second kind that makes Immunities go away.  The following 
three items use the second form of Immunity changing:
Pine o'Clock = Sleep
Rhinoloupe = Poison
Stinky Breath = Poison and Confusion

So, once you add any immunities, don't add those items.  :)

Are you sure you didn't have another Ring Equipped that could have 
had experience sharing?

There is just NO way for the Spirit Card to _not_ grant the Extra 
Lucre Effect, since it's the newer of the Cards (between it and 
Fertility Goddess), and it always grants the Extra Lucre Effect if 
it's present, on a ring...

So you are either mistaken, or your item ended up differently 
(Spirit first, for example).

See, you got me doubting myself now.  Just five minutes ago, I would 
have sworn on a stack of bibles that I placed the Ear of Wheat on 
the ring before the hairball before the whalamato before the moth 
wing.

I will guarantee that I am getting the xp sharing effect.  I will 
check the order of my cards on the subscreen tonight and report 
tomorrow.  (My Internet is, like a lot of people, not in the same 
location as the game)

I firmly believe I put the ear of wheat first.  Is there any 
mechanic that could shuffle the order of cards from their usual, 
should I check and see that the spirit precedes?

There's not much that changes the order of Cards.  However, it IS 
possible that the Hairball didn't even appear - though, you did say 
your item did have the Spirit Card.

Check the order.  If the Fertility Goddess is above the Spirit Card, 
it makes sense.  If the Spirit Card is above the Fertility Goddess, 
however, you're either mistaken about sharing experience, or you're 
wearing something else that shares experience, or you've discovered

I tried the recipe that was given, using 4 lilipods each time. Made 
it out of emerald and even named it TalasCore. But it doesn't have 
the share exp effect for me.

I'm so very terribly sorry for having wasted the groups' time.  I 
checked last night, and the Fertility Goddess is indeed above the 
Spirit.

I clearly misremembered when I applied the hairball.

I am so very embarassed and can hope only that the group will 
forgive my indiscretion.

In other news, thanks for the info on status immunities.  Can you 
tell me how the forge code handles stat bonuses?

No problem!  Don't worry about it.  It wasn't a complete waste of 
time - you know more about tempering, and I know that I still do 
know about tempering.

Bonuses work as follows:
Since the Bonuses are stored in a half-byte, there are only sixteen 
different values, from 0 to 15 (F).
0 = -10
1 = -5
2 = -3
3 = -1
4 = +0
5 = +1
6 = +2
7 = +3
8 = +4
9 = +5
10 = +7
11 = +9
12 = +10
13 = +12
14 = +15
15 = +20

When an item is [+1] to a stat, it raises the number on the left.  
So, it goes from +15 to +20 with one such item.
Here's how the bonuses are applied:
First, the item's [+1] is added to the stat.  Then, the third card 
slot's [+1] or [-1] is added to the stat.  Then, this is done for 
the second card, and finally for the first card.
At the end, the bonuses are brought down to the Limitations, which 
are the most extreme of all of the Card Limitations.  For example, 
having an Evil God anywhere on your equipment automatically makes 
the Limitations -10~+20, since those are the most extreme 
Limitations.
However, if you're at [15] and you add one, it remains at [15], even 
without Limitations looked at yet.  That means if you had 
Leviathan/Yggdrasil/Yggdrasil and added a Toadstoolshed, you'd end 
up at +15 if you were at +15 already, even thought it's [+1+1+1+1-
1], or [+3].  This is because of the order things are looked at.  
Since it's at [14] (+15), the Toadstoolshed raises it to [15].  
Then, the Yggdrasil Card does nothing.  So does the next Yggdrasil 
Card.  Finally, the Evil God Card lowers it to [14].
:)

Get all that?

Bonus Limitations are somewhat more complicated.
Basically, if the current Bonus, at the time of looking at the Card 
(for the Bonus), is withing the Card's Limiations (not the overall 
Limitations), one stat's Minimum Limitation is set to be a higher 
value.  For example, every Evil God Card will set a stat to a 
Limitation of [14] (+15), because the bonuses are _always_ within 
the Evil God Card's Limitations.  If you have three different Evil 
God Cards, you'll have three stats at +15, and they won't lower the 
stats below that because they are basically minimums for the 
Limitations, although a bit different.  That's why I call them Bonus 
Limitations.  :)

I hope this helps.. Heh.

In your pendant one, where youhave 2 wiched eye..... can u se angry 
eye, i mean does it HAVE to be that one, because as I remember,

;-(

Does monster level affect item drop chances? I can say it doesnt seem 
to... at lest not with dragons, I caneasly get like 2 of  there 
armors from then in a figh, that of the flames event easly, more easy 
than getting dragonblod, my blue jaws [polter box duh] luck is 86, 
mine 25. or is this level thing only matter to the chess knight and 
that tree monster, for diro wood?

The Wicked Eye is the only Eye that you can use - all others create 
Pixie Cards, which would be 'A Bad Thing'.
The Wicked Eye is a cardless item that gives 48 energy.
The only substitute is Acid.

Wicked Eyes can't be THAT hard to come by.  I think I find them more 
in treasure chests...
The Flames and the Junkyard have chests with Wicked Eyes in them.

They're also the highest-level drop of the Beholders, as you said.  
Their level IS important - it should be 64 or higher.  And you 
should go hunting with your Polterbox in Synchro (its luck doesn't 
matter, only yours does).

Big Baby and Slime, however, drop Acid very easily - but DON'T bring 
your Polterbox along, because I think it's a level 1/2 drop.

Does the special effects as faster revive when KO'ed,HP wile moveing, 
bed of thorn, money gain, exp. gain being on the equipmentand then 
you give it to be made for the golems weapon and 3 armors affect the 
golem its self?

I know status, elemental defenses do.

I am not sure if Effects have any effect on Golems, although I'm 
pretty sure they do not, unfortunately.

As far as feeding your Polterbox Gold Clover - the main thing, is 
that most people like their pets to have 99 of each stat.  Luck is 
one stat that never raises on its own (except in the case of 
Rabites), and so it requires special attention.
On a Polterbox, it's mostly wasted - you want a Polterbox so that 
YOU do the killing, while it's in Synchro.

As far as using Acid for Creep Eye - that's not possible.  You can 
use Acid instead of Wicked Eye, but not Creepy Eye.
Moth Wing would usually make a good substitute for Creepy Eye, 
however, as both raise Magic Defense.  However, Moth Wing raises 
Magic Defense _more_, but lowers the other defenses.  Note that you 
should only replace a Creepy Eye with a Moth Wing IF the Creepy Eye 
is the last item to be added, as then it's effective as a capper.  
If it's not the last item added, the Pixie Card created is probably 
important.  :)

Sincerely,
JC "Myst Erik Ery"

Well, I'm not exactly sure on the process, but Majarra lists in 
his "Tempering for Dummies" text that you can boost luck with an Evil 
God card in place (he uses Leviathan, maybe it only works for that 
one?) if you use a lot of hairballs and Aura coins. 

I haven't tried it, but no matter what, you'll probably have to keep 
placing the Evil God in, otherwise if it left for good, you'd lose 
all your bonuses due to default restrictions.

Meaning:

Orcaplant
Aura Silver
Aura Silver
Orcaplant
Aura Silver
Aura Silver ... and so on.

He also states that it'll probably give you a -5 or so in every other 
stat but Def.

Hope this helps! Maybe with some trial and error, you can tell me how 
to do it!

- One option: Ghetto Luck -

This recipe will give you +12 Luck, and not much else.  It's not 
great, but it requires zero rare items, making it ideal if you're 
just starting out and want to conserve all your rares.

This should be done on some sort of armor, using any material that 
doesn't have an innate essence (i.e., woods give Dryad all over the 
place).  It'll work on a weapon too, though the very low essence 
levels will result in a weak weapon.  An AnimalBone Pendant or 
similar junk is fine; again, this recipe uses no rare items at all, 
so don't worry about wasting anything.

1> Shade Silver, Moon Crystal, Mush-in-a-Box, or Raven Feather.  This 
raises Shade essence a little bit, which will allow the Metropolis 
card to appear.  Make sure there's zero Salamander essence; 
Salamander will prevent Metropolis from manifesting.
2> Dialaurel.  Buy it from the Bone Fortress after the Field Trip is 
over, just 1000 Lucre.
3> Bumpkin.  In your orchards, crooked seeds plus oblong seeds make 
lots of Spiny Carrots, and a good amount of Bumpkins.  The Metropolis 
card will appear at this step.
4> Aura Silver.  The Clown card will appear at this step.  Clown 
normally relaxes the stat limit on your item to +9, but in the 
presence of the Metropolis, it goes all the way up to +12.
5> Any card producing item.  Holy Water or elemental Mana Stones 
work, Lilipods is fine too.  Crooked seeds plus round seeds makes 
mass amounts of Lilipods in your orchards.  No matter what you use as 
your filler, the Aura card will appear at this step, adding +1 Luck 
to your item, per turn, as long as it's present.
6> Meat, meat, meat, meat, meat, until your Luck maxes at +12.

- Another option: Uberstats -

Using just a couple semi-rares, +20 to all stats can be reached 
fairly easily.  All +20 can be done on DiorWood and other pre-tainted 
materials, but this procedure won't work-- a much scarier and 
costlier procedure is needed.  These recipes include the required 
Dryad essence boost to 5; you may add more essences, just make sure 
Salamander is at 0 before you try putting the Needle/ttuce on.

Material: Orihalcon, any Hide (except Centaur), DragonScales, Ivory, 
any Fabric:

Dryad Silver OR non-Spiny Seed
Sulpher
Sulpher
Needle OR Needlettuce
Any Meat
Spiny Seed
Poison Claw
Spiny Seed
Lilipods (or another filler card of your choice)
Any Meat, repeat until +20 in all stats

Material: Any Metal (except Orihalcon, MaiaLead), any Stone, 
CentaurHide, any Scales (except Dragon), any Bone (except Ivory), any 
Aerolite, any Shell (except Coral), any Gem:
Dryad Silver OR non-Spiny Seed
Sulpher
Sulpher
Sulpher
Dryad Silver OR non-Spiny Seed
Needle OR Needlettuce
Spiny Seed
Poison Claw
Spiny Seed
Lilipods (or another filler card of your choice)
Any Meat, repeat until +20 in all stats

You may optionally add another filler card at the end of either 
version of the recipe.

2 questions:

On a couple of posts, they talk about copying items.  I know that 
you can pawn your altered items to another save and buy it back with 
an earlier save so that you save on the mateirals, is that what 
they're talking about, or can you actually increase your inventory 
somehow?

The database says that the Sacrificed Nymph leaves in lieu of an 
Evil God card, exactly how does that work?

Yes, the pawn-item trick is what people mean when they talk about 
copying items.

Sacrificed Nymph works as follows.

If an Evil God Card is leaving your equipment, and there is a 
Sacrificed Nymph present, the Sacrificed Nymph will leave instead 
and the Evil God Card will move to where the Sacrificed Nymph was.

For example, let's say your equipment has (Sacrificed Nymph)
Dryad/Dryad/Beast-Headed God.

You add a Dryad Silver.  Now, first the Cards become (Dryad)
Sacrificed Nymph/Dryad/Dryad, with the Beast-Headed God Card 
leaving.  However, since an Evil God Card is leaving, and Sacrificed 
Nymph is present in Slots 1-3, the Evil God Card moves to where the 
Nymph is, and she leaves instead.  So, now your Cards become (Dryad)
Beast-Headed God/Dryad/Dryad, with the Sacrificed Nymph Card leaving.
Note that in this particular example, the Sacrificed Nymph doesn't 
add Petrification Immunity or anything else, since it hasn't been 
checked and evaluated by the time it gets removed and replaced.  :)

Most people use the following recipe on armors to get +20 all in 
order to save on Dragon Blood...

Needle(ttuce)
Spiny Seed
Some Evil God Card Producing Item
Spiny Seed
Some Card Producing Item #1
X Meat (till +20 all)
Some Card Producing Item #2 (usually a "varnish" item Like Moth Wing 
or Creepy Eye)

In the Full Metal Gauntlet Recipe hosted on this site, Item #1 is 
Springanana. However, I don't think this recipe would work. Although 
the Heaven's Scale card is there to replace the Bed of Thorns 
effect, it can't be prduced because the Bed of Thorns has already 
been pushed off by the second Yggdrasil card. Item #2 would just 
replace it...

I might be wrong tho.

Just use Gold Clovers. Hunting for Wicked Eyes takes a lot more time

You can get 9/9/9/9/9/9/9/9 only if your resistances for the final 
pair of elements (Sala-Jinn or Undine-Gnome) are BOTH less than 8.
If that's the case, you can get to 9 using 2 Wizard Cards, a leaving 
Nymph of Dawn, and a Gold Coin.
What material were you using?  Dragonscales?  Shouldn't be a 
problem, then.

Just add:
4 Glow Crystal
2 Sulpher
1 Chaos Crystal
1 Gnome Gold
4 Glow Crystal
2 Mercury
1 Chaos Crystal
1 Undine Gold

Since Scales is 7-across, with two Wizard Cards it becomes 1.  1*2^8 
= 256.  So, we need 256 energy to get from 8->9.  Leaving Nymph of 
Dawn is 192, plus 64 from the Gold Coin... Is 256!  Yay!

Well, let's look at it step-by-step.  Assuming all essense levels 
are met..

Needle(ttuce) = (Bed of Thorn)???/???/???
Spiny Seed = (Yggdrasil)Bed of Thorn/???/???
Some Evil God Card Producing Item (EvilGod)Yggdrasil/Bed of Thorn/???
Spiny Seed (Yggdrasil)EvilGod/Yggdrasil/Bed of Thorn
Springanana (Heaven's Scale)Yggdrasil/EvilGod/Yggdrasil

You see, since there was a Bed of Thorn present before tempering, 
you're free to add another World Card.

HOWEVER - you ARE correct, in another sense.  As soon as you add a 
meat to this, you'll end up with (---) in the Invisible Slot, since 
it will remove the World Card that is there.  So it won't quite work 
right :<

I'll have to take a look at that recipe to see if I can make it work 
without having to use Dragon Blood or Toadstoolshed.  It's better on 
a ring, since then you can get an Effect other than NO-HP-REGEN 
without using a World Card.

^_^ Thanks.

Hi there. Does anyone know off-hand if its possible to obtain 
CursedBone as a dropped item from an enemy? I know you can 
get a CursedBone knife from a Dainslaif, but I was hoping to 
make some unique character equipment and all that, and 
CursedBone seems to fight the bill (due to its low resistance to 
Shade).

Also, for the person who posted on the best place to put things 
for the first time through, a good idea (maybe on your second, I 
guess) is to put the Mana Tree next to Gato Grottoes, that way 
you can catch spirits of all types without having to play music in 
the Meditation Room.

Me again. Sorry to keep wasting the time of the group, but I've 
tried and failed repeatedly to do consumptions. I've looked over 
recipes and the Dior Woods don't help me at all, because they 
leave out Dryad, but how exactly is a consumption started and 
utilized? I've read through most of the posts here, and I can't find 
that. Is there a certain order one should add essences? 

I've read the Marcus guide completely a couple of times, and its 
helped learn to raise levels, but I get stuck when it comes time 
to consume. How exactly can this be accomplished? Do I do top 
row first or bottom row?

There are only three Ash per game.  One is in the Bone Fortress, one 
is inside the White Forest, and the last is at Madora Beach.

You cannot get CursedBone as a primary.

However, the following items are pre-made out of CursedBone:

Deathstroke (Knife, Dainslaif)
PeaceMaker (Hammer, Cursed Doll)
Skuldesect (Gloves, Ape Mummy or Narcissos)
SkullHead (Helm, Skeleton)
Dragonbone (Pendant, Spectre)

Consumptions are fairly simple.  A consumption happens when there is 
a TP of the consuming essense, and there is nothing stopping the 
consumption.

For example, under normal circumstances, Salamander will consume 
Gnome.  So, if Gnome is at 5, and you add a Salamander TP (from a 
Sala Gold, for example) Gnome will drain to 4, releasing energy.
However, if Undine was present (Undine > 0), then Salamander can no 
longer consume Gnome (Salamander TPs are ignored when Undine > 0).

The energy released is equal to the energy it takes to get to that 
level, without Wizard Cards.  Thus, you can theoretically drain 
Salamander 1 level, and have it raise 2 levels, by having enough 
Wizard Cards present, draining Salamander, and still being able to 
raise Salamander (not normally possible, since only Undine drains 
Salamander usually, and when that happens, Undine raises to 1, 
leaving Salamander unable to rise...)...

Have I made anything clearer? :/

Ash (primary) is not the same as Ash (secondary).

The first is a kind of wood.  The second is like soot, and it used 
to create the Volcano Card, usually.
They're not the same.

No enemy drops the secondary Ash.  Woodings drop Ash (primary).  As 
I said, you can only find Ash in three places.

That was me - great_legend_of_mana_audio_play is me.

I was just working under that name, on my geocities site.

I'm planning on making a Legend of Mana Audio Play.  It'll be very 
exciting.  However, since I don't have a lot of work done on it, 
there's nothing going to be available for some time ;)

After I get a couple of the first scripts done, I can start getting 
auditions and other things, and it'll be all hunky-dory.

So stay tuned!  It could be fun, and some of you might be interested 
in playing some parts, minor or major.

^_~

Sincerely,
JC (and great_legend_of_mana_audio_play).  :D :D

That's okay!  I could have been wrong, after all, so doubting is a 
good thing.  Of course, on this, I was not wrong.  But IF I was, and 
you just blindly assumed I must be right, even when I didn't seem to 
be, then we'd BOTH be wrong.  Right? :D

Note:

If you try to temper something, you obviously won't find 'AshWood' 
in the list of items, since tempering something shows only Secondary 
items.  Perhaps you were looking there?

In any case, you probably found your other Ash either (a) from the 
Bone Fortress again, on your second time through, (b) from the White 
Forest, or (c) from Madora Beach -- the last two, without noticing :D

Sincerely,
JC

Since I can't view the armour guide i'm going to ask here, can 
someone post the recipe for a high defense armour and which material 
to make it from and all the secondary items needed please?
Will armour have high defense if i use the recipe for the uber items 
guide?
Also what's best to varnish the armour with if i follow the uber 
guide?
I want to make a 1-handed sword and i think i'll follow the uber 
guide either the diorwood or the scale one, i want to know which is 
better, also how do i add the sun god's plunge attack and the moon 
goddess plunge into the sword without affecting it's attack power if 
possible none or little to make a difference?
And finally what varnish is appropriate for the sword?  I've seen 
there's 3 methods but i dunno which one is for the uppercut sort of 
attack when you press down/forward and the square button.

I know this is alot but i hope you wouldn't mind answering these ^.^;

What's wrong with the files?  They're just text files, so I'm not 
sure why you wouldn't be able to open them.

If it's something fixable, or just the fact that Yahoo is being 
stubborn, you can take a look a little while later.

Otherwise, I'll post the contents here....

I've tried a few times a part to open the file for a while, there's 
only a few that i couldn't open at all the others are fine. With the 
armour and the opalla ring thing it doesn't open, each time i click 
it an error apears of 5-10 minutes of loading.
I would appretiate it if you could post the contents.

Everything but that part right there^. I don't think I have the mind 
for tempering, but I refuse to give up. Thank you for your help, I

I can help with this: The Sun God and Moon Goddess add a plunge 
attack into the same plunge slot, so you'll have to pick which you 
want. The Moon Goddess is the easiest to get, I think, and its good 
against water-attributed enemies.

To get the Sun God to appear, you have to have Wisp's levels at 3 at 
the least, and have the overall levels equal 5 or more. For the Moon 
Goddess to appear, Shade has to be level 3 or more. If you want to 
try both, raise Shade's levels first, because you can always raise 
Wisp after Shade, but not vice versa.

Raising the elemental levels will always raise the attack power, but 
the increase is determined by the material, I think. But since you 
only 5 total levels (just do Shade and Wisp, respecively, if you 
don't want to do any more), the overall increase won't be that much.

As for 1H swords, varnishing is 3 Bumpkins and a Sharp Claw.

As far as Plunge Attacks go, if you look at the chart(s) on the 
Majarra guide (found here: 
http://db.gamefaqs.com/console/psx/file/legend_of_mana_temper_b.txt) 
any Plunge attack that is in the same category will always replace 
that slot. Like the Sun God and Moon Goddess's plunges will always 
lose the 'Jump'.

Hope any of this helps!

There are four Mirror Pieces per game.

Madora Beach, the Underworld, the Bejewelled City, and the Mana Tree.

You can get more than just four, though, because of the New Game +.  
When you beat the game, you can continue your save and start all 
over again, from the beginning, but with the stuff you had before 
(items, equipment, pets, golems, instruments, level, etc.) on a new 
map.

So you can get 16 Mirror Pieces in four runthroughs, if you remember 
to get them all each time.

Energy is what you need to raise an essense level.

The energy requirement to get to X level is equal to: (Resistance) * 
2^(X-1)

So, if your Resistance is 7, and you're wanting to get to level 9, 
you'll need (7 * 2^8) or 1792 energy.

This is impossible, of course.  The highest energy you can get from 
an item is 96 (Glow Crystal), and you can get 288 from a Glow 
Crystal + Nymph of Dawn (when Nymph of Dawn leaves, you gain 192 
energy).

However, Wizard Cards (Sorcerer for Wisp/Dryad/Salamander/Gnome, 
Witch for Shade/Aura/Jinn/Undine) lower resistances.
So, with two Wizard Cards, Resistance 7 becomes Resistance 1.
That means you only need (1 * 2^8) or 256 energy to get to level 9, 
with two Wizard Cards.
This can be done rather easily with a Nymph of Dawn leaving and 
either a Gold Coin or some other 64+ energy item, while there's a TP 
present (as you can only raise one point per TP, no more).

However, how would you get past 9, then?  You'll have to use 
consumptions, since that's the only way to get more than 288 energy.
If you had resistance 32, and you were going from level 15 to level 
14, you would get a total of (32 * 2^14) energy, or 524288 energy.  
As you can see, that's QUITE a bit more than 288 (although, it IS a 
bit extreme, since you're going to need about that much energy to 
GET to level 15 in the first place :P ).

Does THIS help at all?

> As for 1H swords, varnishing is 3 Bumpkins and a Sharp Claw.

1H Swords are balanced.  That is, they have no best varnish.  It 
will depend solely on the material used.

3/4 Bumpkin, Sharp Claw (for Sharp)
3/4 Ash, Scissors (for Force)
3/4 Holy Water, Giant's Horn (for Heavy)

You'll have to look at the material's properties to determine what 
to use.  For example, DiorWood works best with Sharp, whereas 
Dragonscales is better for Heavy.

Sorry again, but i was following the uber recipe guide using the 
dragonscale on so far i've encountered someme problems which is 
easily overcome by using higher levels of materials like you say but 
on the secound E section i can't seem to raise Jinn to level 9 as it 
said if i follow the guid it's only on 6, if i switch it all to gold 
coins i only manage to get a level 8 on jinn can anyone tell me how 
to overcome this and give me a 9 in jinn while retaining all the 
other essences?

At that point, you can't do anything to lose any essenses.

Just add:
4x glow crystal
chaos crystal
2x mercury
jinn gold

Again, and it'll raise to 9.  There's a simpler way, but I can't 
think of it at the moment.

You'll have to repeat the last four steps of the Salamander raising, 
too, to get it to 9.

Actually, Sunlight (the Plunge from Sun God) is an Uppercut, whereas 
Moonlight (the Plunge from Moon Goddess) is a Jump.
So you can have both Sunlight and Moonlight on the sword.  Just add 
1x Moon Crystal, 1x Sun Crystal to the end of your tempering, but 
before capping/varnishing.
Vampsword (Witch of Moon) and Flametongue (God of Destruction) are 
also Uppercut Plunge Attacks, so if you want either of those two, 
you'll have to not have Sunlight.

Those are a bit trickier to add, too.  You'll have to use Ragnarok 
and a Pixie, at the end, to properly get them on there.  :)

Thanks, it worked and fixed the problem, but now i have another one, 
i was trying out the diorwood one the one with 104, cause i can't 
access the 105 =/, and for the last process of getting sala to 7 i 
can't seem to get it their it's stuck on 6, also if can i change the 
104 essences to 105? or is it a completely different recipe that i 
would need to follow?
Oh, can someone post the armour one? i need some armour ^.^
Thanks again

It's completely different.

You're at the end, right?  Just need to raise Sala, and that's it?
If so, just add:
4 Glow Crystal
2 Sulpher
1 Chaos Crystal
1 Sala Gold

That should bump you up to 7...

For armor, your only way of raising defense is basically Bed of 
Thorns.
So, add any seed, and then add 3 Needlettuce, and you've got the best 
armor you can get --- but, you can't restore any HP.
Also note that Dragonscales makes the best physical-defense armor, 
whereas Adamantite makes the best magical-defense armor...

I'm sorry i'm not too sure i understand, if i use the uber recipe 
and i do what you've you stated i get really good armour but i can't 
heal, as in the hp won't regenarate as i fight? can i get a moderate 
armour and wear another like a helm or sheild to boost the defense 
but still heal as i fight?  or to have really good defense and no 
healing a better option?

It is very difficult to raise all essenses and still get Bed of 
Thorn - Bed of Thorn requires 0 Salamander, so you can't raise 
Salamander at all.

Here's the Armor .txt:

DragonScaleArmor and AdamantitePendants are the "best" armor because
they have the highest values for material and equipment type.
Pendants also allow you to get all of the status immunities on a
single item.

1. Max armor values
Great high defense, but you can't regenerate hp.
  DragonScaleArmor 98/98/99/6
    round seed
    3 needle(ttuce)
    sleepy eye
  AdamantitePendant 0/0/0/95
    stinky breath
    fire stone
    sulpher
    sulpher
    holy water
    zombie claw
    blackened Bat
    ghost howl
    sharp claw
    water stone
    fishy fruit
    squalphin
    round seed
    3 needle(ttuce)
    moth wing

2. High armor values
Pretty much the same the same as the first one but uses heaven scales
card from springana to you can regenerate hp (even while moving), but
now you can't revive.
  DragonScaleArmor 65/65/68/4
    round seed
    2 needle(ttuce)
    springana
    sleepy eye
  AdamantitePendant 0/0/0/78
    stinky breath
    fire stone
    sulpher
    sulpher
    holy water
    zombie claw
    blackened Bat
    ghost howl
    sharp claw
    water stone
    fishy fruit
    squalphin
    round seed
    2 needle(ttuce)
    springana
    moth wing

3. High stats
With a maxed out hp stat you'll regenerate damage faster than you can
take it in most situations. This setup also raises your luck more 
than
the others can. Since the armor values aren't critical to this setup
you can make the first three items out of anything (the shoes show 
what
needs to change to work on wood). The pendant recipe relies on the
particular resistances of adamantite in a number of places, but it 
can
be replaced with menos bronze and any other material with the same
resistances.
  Mantle
    round seed
    3 sulpher
    round seed
    sun crystal
    needle(ttuce)
    spiny seed

Thanks for posting it. some more quietions. =P
I hope i don't sound stupid or something but is it good to have 
essences on an armor?  or you don't really need them?  Can i make a 
ring with all status resistance and have revive(phoenix) in it?
and wear a high defense armour with no regenarate yet wear a shield 
that is alright in defence but has regenative properties and still 
heal or will it cancel out if i wear them both?

Each type of armor requires a different essense value to get 
an "Elemental Defense Marker".  That's all you need - the actual 
value doesn't matter, so long as you have the marker.  However, 
these markers aren't exactly all that useful either, since I don't 
know how much they reduce anything by ACTUALLY (and who gets hit 
with magic, anyway?).

You cannot make a ring with all status immunities.  Only Pendants 
can have all status immunities.  Yes, you can make a Pendant with 
all status immunities and the instant-Revive Effect (or make it a 
Ring with many status immunities, but not all).

No, you can't equip one thing that stops regeneration and one that 
doesn't, and regenerate.  Any equipment you have that has the Bed of 
Thorn's "No HP Regen" Effect will make sure you don't restore ANY HP 
at all, ever, if you have it equipped.  No matter what else you have 
equipped.

No HP Regen isn't a big loss.  You can make a "Candy Machine Golem", 
or grab a Lizardon for Pak'n Choco.  Or, you can just use Quick 
Attack + Tackle + Tackle + Tackle + Tackle + etc... Until a Candy 
Pops out, if you NEED to heal.

Thanks, can you clear up something from the armour.txt, where it 
says you can't revive getting moderate armour yet has hp-
regenarative, does that me if you're knocked out and you have a 
partner still fighting it won't goto 100% and you can fight again?
And how do you make the pendant with revive, keeping it's previous 
properties?

The Armor that has Heaven's Scale present, while letting you 
Regenerate HP while moving and while standing still (unlike armor 
that has Bed of Thorn's NO HP Regen effect), has one bad side 
effect - you do not revive.  That is, your gray meter never fills 
up.  So yes, if you're knocked out and you have a partner still 
fighting, it won't raise back up to 100% and fully revive you.

To make a pendant with Revive, simply put Volcano and Phoenix on it 
at the same time.  Those are all you need for the Revive Effect.  
Note that the Volcano Card can leave after the Effect is added, but 
if Phoenix leaves, you will actually LOSE the Effect.  The Revive 
Effect also only works once, as after it is used up the topmost 
Phoenix Card will be removed and it will lose the Effect.  Neither 
Volcano nor Phoenix have anything to do with losing Essense Markers 
or Status Immunites, so you're save there.
However, the fact that this is a two-Card Ability makes it very 
difficult to have +20 All Stat Bonuses on the same Pendant, 
especially since you'll want to be adding more Phoenixes afterwards 
to re-add the Revive Effect.

i have a question about polter boxes.  when attempting to get a rare 
item while synchro-ing with my polter box (mr. pokey) do i synchro at 
the moment of impact, at the moment the enemies explode, just before 
the bag drops, or during the entire time from impact until the bag 
drops.  help on this will save much time, thank you!

A Polterbox's Synchro takes effect only on the strike that defeats 
the enemy.
So, just ensure that your last hit against the enemy was in Synchro 
with the Polterbox, and you're guaranteed to get an item (except 
against Chess Knights) due to the Synchro, even if you wander away 
from your Polterbox while the enemy explodes.

You could follow the Dragonscales Uberrecipe, but if you want the 
highest possible, go with the "1 point extra" DiorWood formula 
(which is really inefficient, but works, and gives you 987 or so 
attack power, heh)...

This is my formula for a sword that gets around 100 with ishe
(untested):

Make Sword
Holy Water X3
Giants Horn

But, i need a stronger sword. I need something that can create 
UNIMAGINABLE DESTRUCTIVE POWER!!!... i mean a good weapon Maybe 
around 200?
P.S. i have no intention of going and getting a bunch of stuff from 
monsters, so all materials should be buyable

  uhm..... just curious cause i had gone to a site where had the mana 
cards as picstures, and one interested me to, what is that, since I 
never saw it, maybe thought it's a weapon special attack, but what 
card is, that what I saw, looks like a big great White Whale with a 
unicorn horn, comming out of the water?

That card is "Unicorn".

As a side note, the horned whale is a real creature. It's called a "narwhal".

I have discovered that certain names affect different types of 
weapons!!!

so far this is what i have:
1HAxe=Tetsaiga
2HSword=Ragnarok
Glove=Osiris

These give invisible bonusses, it won't show on your weapon stats
but you will get +1 to all essences, +5 to luck, +10 to Offence!!!

Don't worry more are on the way!!!

Prove it.

Naming your weapon _never_ changes the attack power, so it doesn't 
give you +1 to all essenses, first off.

Second, Ragnarok is the name of an ordinary dropped 2HSword, if I 
recall correct.  Remember that dropped equipment has different 
attack power and bonuses than ordinarily forged equipment, but that 
if you add anything to it, they'll all be recalculated.

Welcome to the Group!  I like seeing new members actually being 
active.

Dior Wood is dropped by high-level Woodings.  I suggest No Future - 
you can fight the lone Wooding in Gato Grottoes by selecting 'To The 
Waterfall', and then backtracking into the Dungeon and heading to 
the right.

Altena Alloy is a reward for late-end "Metal" Events.  For 
information on Metal Events, you should read my AF/Event FAQ 
(located here: http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/psx/game/24026.html ) 
although I do not know the exact Land Strength required for Altena 
Alloy.
Fortunately, Altena Alloy is not as good as Dior Wood or 
Dragonscales for tempering, and not as good as Dior Wood for magical 
instruments.

Gaeus's Tears is dropped by Chimera Beasts.  I suggest No Future - 
other than the few on Lucemia, the only other place I know of with 
Chimera Beasts is deep, deep down in the Underworld.  I'm not 100% 
of their location, but they're down there somewhere.

Sincerely,
JC Myst Erik Ery

i've grown to love the spin and tackle abilities and have noticed 
something about spin.  sometimes when i use spin and add an attack 
the spin attack will sometimes dizzy me.  is this based on the 
attribute that has to do with status effects on the character, or the 
position of the character when the attack is done? but further more 
can this be prevented?

I've only had the dizzy-ing problem when I'm spinning without 
attacking, or spinning and Quick-Attacking.

You can try spinning and Power Attacking, instead, although I'm not 
sure if it prevents you being dizzy.

It's not based on anything, as far as I know, other than simply the 
fact that Spin can Dizzy you.

yeah i've used the quick attack and don't seem to dizzy but when 
using the power attack i dizzy sometimes.  however with my new armor 
set up that maxes out my stats i haven't dizzied as much no matter 
how many times i do so or regardless of quick or power attack.  i'm 
gonna try using an armor that protects against that particular status 
effect and get back to the group on that.

The higher your essence total, the more attack power you get from 
weapons.
This is due to something called "Growth Control".

Each material property is multiplied by this formula:

(Growth Control + Essence Total) / Growth Control

Thus, lower Growth Control and higher Essence Totals make for better 
weapons.  With 100 Essence points total, you're nearly multiplying 
the original attack power by 9, and that's without multiplying due 
to Varnishing (which usually doubles the attack power at least)...

On armor, the only thing that matters is Essence Markers - each type 
of armor has a different essence requirement for Essence Markers.  
For pendants, for example, you need only one Essence for a marker.  
For armor, you need four (I think).
Once you have the Essence Marker, you'll get reduced damage from 
that element, although nobody is exactly sure how much, or if 
multiple Aura-marker armors will protect you more from Aura than 
only one...

Finally, essences are important for getting certain Mystic Cards.  
Yggdrasil, for example, requires 5 Dryad, while Nymph of the Sky 
requires Wisp essence of 3 or more, and a total of 5 or more, to 
appear.

^__^

Does this help?

How'd that recipe work out?  Got some spare dragonscales left over 
from blood farming, and been wanting to change into something a 
little... Not 2hs-ish.  Seeing how that's the only weapon I've ever 
used since the beginning of the game.  Very fascinated by the gloves 
in general (thanks Secret of Mana), and was thinking of making a 
pair... One that hopefully had more than 316 offense (because that's 
where my 2hs is at... heh, I'm really not all that good at this 
smithing thing)

That recipe will give you FAR more than 316 Attack Power - closer to 
800, I'd think.

107 Essences (the maximum on Dragonscales, I think) doesn't let you 
reach 999 with Gloves, sadly, but it's better than 103 / 104 
Essences on DiorWood, due to the material...
So if you use the Uberrecipe, that's the BEST glove you'll ever 
get.  Using the 100-Total one, you won't have the BEST--- but it'll 
be pretty darned close.

I've tried with a 99 luck polter box pet, standing in synch with him 
on killshots.  In the White Forest at lvl 99.  All I got to show for 
about 5 hours of work is a whoooooole lotta ebony and baobob wood.  
No dior.

I can't do the uber recipes due to the lack of mirror pieces (2), and 
it's been so damn long since I've played this game, I have no idea 
how to get the mana tree up so I can conquer it and restart and get 
more mirror shards.  Kinda want to use what I got on hand anyways.

The other challenge is I have read the guides over and over and 
over... But for some reason, I just can't seem to grasp the methods 
of tempering up essences.  >_<  Especially as high as 107 total.  My 
weapon has like.. uhh.. 41.  Heh, I had no IshePlatinum, and already 
had constructed one (really crappy one.  Back before Kelson tempering 
existed)... So I just tried a recipe on it, and got some ok results.  
Not quite what it should have turned out to be, but was better than 
the 67 offense 2h I was using.

Grow them.  The orchard at home or the orchard artifact will be able 
to grow them.  Give the trees small seeds.  Or I suppose you could 
use a combination of oblong and crooked seeds...  But small would be 
your best bet.

Bumpkins are produce that must be grown (that is, you can't buy them 
at the Bone Fortress).  However, they're not very rare.  Simply try 
Small Seed + Small Seed --- Bumpkin is an Orange-coloured produce.

Just buy Gold Clover for 1000 Lucre a pop at the Bone Fortress.

Just 1 Wind Cap + 4 Clear Feathers is worth a little over 26 of these 
beauties, so if you have done any money-tempering at all, you've 
likely enough to buy 99 Gold Clovers..

If you REALLY want to know, Spiny Seed + Round Seed has the best 
chances of yielding a Gold Clover (6.25%).

It worked out ok. Its mainly an exercise in understanding 
consumptions. Sort of a meta-recipe to share some of the idioms of 
tempering.

The uber recipe is much shorter, but it doesn't really try to get you 
to understand tempering at all. A number of people get lost when the 
last step mistakenly uses mercury instead of sulpher.

Yeah.  Everything I have equipped right now is from someone else's 
recipe.  Just did it so I could at least be able to progress in No 
Future mode and gather the materials first.  Slowly but surely 
starting to understand the process bit by bit.  Just the whole thing 
of memorizing new formulas and being able to apply them all within a 
grand scheme of things is something I've never been good at.

And makes it harder when everything is taught by text.  Can't ask it 
questions and get an answer.

Just need to table and chart the variables myself, and hopefully be 
able to start smithing anything I want without a pre-published recipe.

Also, made some gloves, and really think the graphic on them is 
crap.  Would be better if they had no graphic at all like in SoM.  
Hehe, so I'm thinking I'm gonna be more into spears or something ;)

Hi people!!!
Ive seen your posting in Gamefaqs about this group, and it seems to 
be a fun a group.
I have few question regarding of item, especially rare item
Is there any way to increase the chance to get this item? Ive bring a 
polterbox, kill a wooding, chimera beast, chess knight,etc, and all i 
get is not what i want. Hollywood, marble,healing claw...
And,is the land effect you to get and item. Like i get a devil fork
(altena alloy spear)from imp in lucemia, and not in other land

Level is also another factor.  If a monster is lvl 40 or under, 
there's like nil chance you'll get a rare item like DiorWood or 
DragonScales.  So beat the game and change to Nightmare or No Future 
mode to help increase your chances.

I'm sure I don't need to remind you to stand next to your polter box 
when you land the finishing blow for the synch effect, but also 
wouldn't hurt to max his luck up to 99.  Kinda tedious, but all pet 
growth is.  Buy Gold Clovers from Bone Fortress and put them in the 
polter box's feed box (two at a time), and then go xp with him a 
little until he levels up, go back, put in two more, go level him, go 
back, etc, etc, etc.  Should take somewhere near 50 clovers and 25 
levels to get his luck all the way up.  It may or may not have a big 
impact, but still never hurts.  If anything, it's at least good 
superstition =p

Also reported better rare item drops if you farm them on Aura day.

So max out your box's luck, put it on No Future mode, go on Aura day, 
and have some patience.  I was farming a bunch of dragon blood for 
the beefy amulet, and in the like 4 hours it took in Fieg Snowfields 
to get 15 vials, I seen 2 DragonScales drop.  So the rare components 
can take a while.

Good luck!

Buyable in a level 1 shop.  Domina will have a level 1 always if I 
remember correctly.  Go into the Inn and go into the room on the 
right at the top of the stairs.

Was just fixing to finally settle down and spend some time to Red 
Mage up a pet.  I think I settled on a Sky Dragon as the partner I 
want to take out when I want to do some damage.  But was trying to 
plot out a diet, and I got curious...

Only meats I know of that increase pet stats are Animal, Bug and 
Lizard.  I have 74 Dragon Steaks from farming blood for the pendant, 
so I figured I'd look around and see if they did anything.  Having 
not found any data on the subject, I decided to parse some data for 
myself.  Got my level 1 Sky Dragon, fed him one Dragon Steak, went 
and leveled him, fed him one Dragon Steak, leveled him, rinse, 
lather, repeat.  Well, my original plan was to get him to level 11, 
each time feeding him one steak per level, then subracting the values 
he would normally gain from leveling to see what the steaks gave him 
stat wise.  Well, after 4 levels, his stats are exactly congruent 
with what they normally would be as if you fed him nothing at all.  
So I guess I've come to the conclusion that Dragon Steaks give no 
beneficial or detrimental stats per feeding.

But what about other meats?  Odd, Morph, etc.  Do those give any 
beneficial stats?  Or is Animal/Bug/Lizard the only ones?  I figure 
someone else has probably done the parsing already within the last 3 
years, so wanted to check and see if anyone else knew anything in 
that regard before I go spend a week parsing the effects of all 
meats, only to find that those previous 3 listed were the only ones 
with any beneficial properties =P

You are correct.  Only Animal/Bug/Lizard Meats affect pets at all, 
and all meats have the same effect in tempering - they provide 16 
energy and that is it.

Dragon Steaks are best sold.

My advice is to go buy them.  1000 Lucre a pop at the vendor at Bone 
Fortress, but even if they were 5000 a pop, I'd still buy them.  
They're stupidly rare to actually grow.  About 6% if you use 
Spiny/Round combination, and about 3% if you use Flat/Round 
combination.

1k is really absolutely nothing.  Go to Lake Kilma (or Luon Highway) 
and farm WindCaps from Spiny Cones and Clear Feathers from Stinger 
Bugs.  Get 4 Feathers per Cap.  Forge 4 Feathers into one Cap.  Go 
sell.  Poor man's way of Lucre farming.  Also posted a recipe that 
adds 40k Lucre value to a weapon in Files.  Yields more Lucre return, 
but requires Pine 'O Clocks to temper in for the Ragnarok card.  
They're a bit uncommon to farm though.

Also note a few things about raising Luck in pets.  Gold Clovers 
yield 2 Luck per Clover when your pet levels up.  I think the max 
stat growth you can have in a pet per level up is 2.75.  So if you 
feed him one Gold Clover (L1000), his Luck goes up by 1.  If you feed 
him two Gold Clovers (L2000), his Luck goes up by 2.75.  If you feed 
him three Gold Clovers (L3000), his Luck goes up by 2.75.  So don't 
bother feeding your pet 3 at a time.  And only feed him two at a time 
if you're very insistant on maxxing his Luck quickly.  Just adding 
one Gold Clover per feeding is the most economical and effecient way 
to spend your Lucre/time spent farming Gold Clovers.

Someone chime in if I'm wrong.

You're right, but he was asking about all sorts of produce, and not 
just Gold Clovers (which I already suggested to simply buy).

One small thing to note: Luck only helps the person who does the 
killing.  So, raising a Polterbox's Luck is pointless.  Why?  A 
Polterbox does NOT benefit from its own Synchro.
You'll get rarer items killing the enemy yourself with the Rare Item 
Synchro than by letting the Polterbox (or any other Pet, for that 
matter) kill them.

Of course, you should try to max the Luck of any pets you like to 
use - then you'll find rarer items when just plain wandering!

This Group is for discussion of Legend of Mana.  I realize that the 
topic can stray somewhat, at times - this is not bad.
Talking about any of the Seiken Densetsu games - or games in 
general - is perfectly acceptible and welcomed.

However, if you come here just to post spam (that is, unsolicited 
advertising or messages that are completely different from the 
subject of this Group), please be advised that I delete the spam 
from the Group's Message Archive and remove you from the group.

I do not ban unless there is a recurring problem, so you can always 
join again if you realize you were out of line.  So don't feel 
afraid to talk about things that MIGHT be considered off-topic.  So 
long as you're here to talk about Legend of Mana, too, there's no 
problem!
And, as always, you can contact me via Messenger or personal email 
to ask if something is too off-topic, or even ask for permission to 
post a link to another site even if it isn't a Legend of Mana-
related site.

Finally, do not reply to messages that could be considered 'spam'.  
Doing so is also 'spam' itself, considering #1 --- it gets sent to 
the group.  It's nice to know other people don't like it, but it's 
just as constructive as the original message, so it's a little 
hypocritical.  #2 --- the original message is often sent in the 
reply.  I can't just delete the message, then - the message remains 
intact and available for viewing.

Thank you for your time!

Furthest extent of my knowledge... Level is what affects the drop 
rate on rare items.  Which is why most farming is done on Nightmare 
or No Future mode.  If the mob is under level 40, there is nil chance 
of getting access to the rarer items from it's loot table.  Also, 
some 'superstition' in regards to farming on Aura days.  Some say on 
any day, it takes like an average of 2 hours to get a piece of 
DiorWood.  Some say on Aura days, it takes half hour to an hour.  
Takes less than a minute to arrange your farming to land on Aura day, 
so why not try?  Also, drops are mob based, not location based.  So 
you can get DiorWood from the Woodlings in Gato, White Forest or Mana 
Tree, just whichever yields the highest level Woodlings is where you 
want to farm.

Also, as far as a map goes for like Jungle... Could self map it.  If 
no graph paper, could make squares on a regular sheet of paper with a 
pencil and a ruler.  And just mark down what direction you went, and 
maybe put a little note like what mobs are in that particular screen.

Was trying to farm Moth Wings one day in the Jungle with the x2 
Zombine/Gloomoth combo in a screen, and after like an hour, got what 
I needed, and on my way out, I came across a screen that was just 2 
Gloomoths.  Took 10 minutes to get the same amount of wings from them 
as it did the previous encounter, due to loading time between screens 
as well as twice the chances of getting the drop.

Err, sorry.  Meant to say Level is the only thing that affects drop 
rate as far as land placement goes.

Luck on the one who landed the finishing blow is another factor you 
can control (eg: get your Luck as high as possible).

Also, the synch on Polterbox pets makes them your farming friend.  If 
you're in synch with the box when you land the finishing blow, it 
forces the mob to drop an item.  More specifically, a higher chance 
of a rare item.

So head to the Junkyard and get some eggs until one hatches into a 
Polterbox and use it's synch to help you farm rare items.

If I knew where the edit was, I would have editted my previous 
message instead of replying with another, so forgive me =p

The funny thing about the jungle is that it has a different layout 
before and after you remove the faerie spell.

And a number of maps have one way passages, such that if you go back 
the way you came you won't end up where you were.

Hehe, well you can do what I do and avoid the Jungle like the 
plague.  Do the same with Mindas Ruins too.  Those two lands just bug 
the hell out of me...  Can't stand any of the quests related to them 
=p

Aside from quests, only thing I have ever needed in the Jungle was 
Moth Wings for tempering.

It's dependant on the enemy's level only.  Land Placement affects 
enemy levels, but if you place Lucemia early and close to home, then 
the Imps at the Junkyard will probably be a higher level (especially 
if you place it far away and very late).

Use one of the recipes on this site to make your weapon.  Pick one 
that raises every essence up a considerable amount.

Then simply add a Pine o'Clock and top it up with 4 Bumpkins and a 
Sharp Claw to cap it.

I tried to temper my diorwood 2 hand axe to 999 in attack.  I had a 
couple of misfires. I used a method found in one of the faqs in 
gamefaqs.  I asked around on how I could correct them but I was told 
I couldn't.  I know I didn't make any mistakes while tempering so 
maybe someone will know of a better method.  Who ever responds to 
this if you know the method I am asking about can you post it in a 
response.  I have tried to find previously posted messages on this 
subject but I have not been able to find it.

I found the dior wood recipe.  But I have a question with it.  Where 
it says to use an essence it just says the name of the essence.  Do I 
need to use a silver or gold.  I know some explictly say gold but 
others dont.  Does that mean I should use silver.

That's right.  Save after each step, however, and if something 
doesn't work, try using Gold Coins instead.  ^_^

Can some one give me a recipe for a knife made of Lorant Silver with 
a strength of 120+ with Poison Blade as one of the plunges. Please 
send to azurazero@aol.com as well as my yahoo. If this is not 
possible, or you have a way for higher, please explain it to me. It 
doesn't have to be detailed, I only need a basic explanation.

Poison Blade takes up the same slot as quick blade so you won't be
able to use the usual varnish. But using the tempering_1.0.txt recipe
and ending with

pine oclock
bumpkin
bumpkin
dangerous eye
lilipod
sharp claw

should get you a 208 lorant silver knife with poison blade.

Thanks. The varnishing was my major problem. I couldn't figure what 
was causing the difficulties. I'm a veritable newby to tempering and 
have little experience figuring out my tempering mistakes.

how do you drain these?  if wisp and shade is both at 7 can you drain
them?  If not, why?  If so how?  On any material or just some
materials?  What is the process the weapon goes thru when you drain? 
how much energy is released at each step and how is it applied to the
item?  How does the sorcerer and witch cards fit into all of this as
well.

Thanks

TP = Taining Point.  You get one of these per Essence Card, and one 
from some items, of a particular Essence.  Each TP allows the Essence 
to raise by 1.

If Wisp > Shade and there is a Wisp or Shade TP present, Shade will 
drain to 0.
If Wisp > Shade and there is a Dryad TP present, Aura will drain one 
level.
If Shade > Wisp and there is an Aura TP present, Dryad will drain one 
level.
If Shade = Wisp, Aura and Dryad are free to raise freely.

Under Mirrored World:
If Shade > Wisp and there is a Wisp or Shade TP present, Wisp will 
drain to 0.
If Shade > Wisp and there is a Dryad TP present, Aura will drain one 
level.
If Wisp > Shade and there is an Aura TP present, Dryad will drain one 
level.
If Shade = Wisp, Aura and Dryad are free to raise freely.

Energy gained from a drain is equal to:
( Resistance * 2^(New Level) )
This is done BEFORE lowering resistances with Wizard Cards, so you 
can theoretically drain something, and then use the energy it 
produces to raise itself AND something else up, by lowering the 
Resistance through the use of Wizard Cards.

If Shade and Wisp are at 7, it's likely possible to drain ONE of them 
to 0, but the other will have to be at least at 8, then.  You can 
never lower the Wisp-or-Shade Total below whatever it's at now.  So, 
if you have 0/1, you can never get to 0/0.  Only to 2/0 or 0/2 (or 
2/1 or 1/2, but those are like 'duh', yesno?).  At 2/0, you can only 
get to 0/3 or 3/0 or some other combination involving a 3.
So if you have 7/7, you can only get 8/0 or 0/8.  ^_^
See?

After a lot of time, I got myself playing this game again. Since this 
is one of my favorite games, I quick got addicted... for the fourth 
time.

So, I'm joining you all. Now, to the subject:

1- I can't post too much. Rarely, to be precise. Just to tell...

2- There is a chance to do - or anybody did - a perfect 1h sword? 
damage 999, max atribute bonus, max mana and a plunge attack to mix?  
I always dreamed to do such sword, just to call it "Sword of Mana"...

3- To whatever is the one who posted the card pictures... you have my 
gratitude. They are beautiful...

See ya!

Strongest 1HSword is 977 (986 or somesuch with the 105 Essences 
recipe), with +9 all stats and any plunges you like.  DiorWood is 
best for Swords, but swords generally are some of the worst 
equipments in existance due to their balanced attributes.

Highest 1hand sword possible is 986 with +9 to all stats using Dior 
Wood.  If you wanted higher stat bonuses you'd really lose out  on 
the attack power and sala essence.

On the other hand, you can make a 999 DragonScale Hammer with +20 
stats + plunge.  But this only because Hammers have an obscenely 
high natural Force rate which makes the Varnish do wonders with the 
attack value.  A 2 Handed Axe version would be in the low 900's (999 
for Diorwood, but no Salamander)

Here are 2 numbers for ya

DragonScales 1handed Sword with +20 stats: 585 attack power

Diorwood 1handed Sword with +20 stats: 687 attack power (Salamander 
must be 0)

Not being a smithing guru, I can't quite offer recipes and comments 
to add, other than maybe go 2hs instead of 1hs.

Then you can craft up a master suit of armor, put on a sick pendant 
(recipe found in the recipes posted on the site, 20 to all stats with 
resistance to everything), and have a spot for a smithing up a 
ForbiddenRing 2.0, or another stat buster item if you're done with 
raising pets.

You can get a 999 2handed Sword from either Diorwood(Slash +9 stats)=20
or DragonScales(Force +1 Stats) (Slash version would be 991 +9=20
stats).  As for recipes, just look under the files section, recipe=20
folder, uber recipes.

There is no such plunge of Icebrand for Swords.  Closest thing is=20
Icicle which is an Unique Plunge on some Bows the Chobinhoods drop=20
(just in case, I took a peek in Terences Forge Code.txt just verify=20
before I typed this, plunges ain't my thing :P ).

Icebrand exists as a Plunge, if I recall correctly, but I don't=20
think it's attainable even on premade equipment.
There's certainly no way to add it with a Mystic Card, or something.

Remember which sword its on?  I went hopping from FAQ to FAQ looking 
for a refrence of it, and only saw it in some Gameshark codes.

Notice that he said it's not available, "even on premade equipment". As far as I know, the Icebrand plunge is one of three (?) plunge attacks that are completely impossible to get without a code editor.

Is there anything special about these impossible plunges, anyway? Are they very powerful?

No problem!

No, as far as I know, the unobtainable Plunges are just as special 
as ordinary Plunges - that is, not very.
They slightly change damage and provide various bonuses or statuses 
against certain monster types and sometimes raise or lower your or 
your enemy's stats... But other than that, there isn't anything 
particularly unique about any Plunge Attacks other than Golden Touch 
and Hand of Midas --- these, if used to defeat the enemy, change all 
Exp Crystals to Lucre.

Yeah, this plunge was only told to me by a guy who found it by 
gameshark. Too bad, but thanks anyway.

TY...

A couple more question...

I have only been able to get shade/wisp to 6 on altena alloy.

Is there a table/can you provide a table that specifically shows
shade/wisp resistences through essense level 9 (or higher)?

Also the only table that I've seen goes up to lev 9.  Does anyone know
about the higher levels?  Also wisp and shade confuse the whole table
as well, since they don't apply but the rest of the essenses seem to
apply.

> Energy gained from a drain is equal to:
> ( Resistance * 2^(New Level) )

so if I drain shade using wisp, I will get (AltenaAlloy)

10 * 2^7 

10 * 128

  1280  energy right?

when I use a wisp tp on the object, shade didn't drain so I'm gonna
try to drain one of the 4 elements (gnome, sala, jinn, undine) to see
if that works.

my ultimate goal is to reverse wisp/shade on the weapon(6wisp/6shade)
and drop wisp back to 0 so I can up shade as high as possible.  With
aura/dryad equal and all other elements at 0 how would this be best
accomplished(with least amount of mirror pieces used)?

I know I ask a lot but I would appreciate any help any of you could
give me.

Thanks

Concerning the Wisp Shade draining.

Lets take your example of have 6 Wisp and 6 Shade.

If you Drain Shade by making Wisp 7, you'll get ALL the energy from 
Shade 0 => 6.  Meaning you'll get

10*2^0 + 10*2^1 + 10*2^2 + 10*2^3 + 10*2^4 + 10+2^5 = 630 Energy

OR

(10*2^6) - 10 = 630 (you'd subtract whatever the essence resistance 
to get the correct value)

When it comes to draining Wisp/Shade Essences, it would look like 
you'd get more energy than you actually do.  To date there haven't 
been any "practical" uses for draining Wisp/Shade.

Without Draining, you could get Wisp/Shade/ConflictEssence to 7.  
Everything else can get to 9. (7/7/9/9/9/7/9/7) *have done this*

I should point out that in your example, you won't be able to get 
Shade => 7 without the use of Draining and a Mirrored Piece (this is 
due to the fact Wisp is present).  Normally you could go 6 => 7 by 
adding Glow, Glow Glow, Mercury, Mercury, Shade, Glow.

With JUST draining I "think" that you can get the final essence 
values of 12/12/11/11/10/7/10/7 On AltenaAlloy  <= This is still 
possible with your setup.  Though it would take an absurd amount of 
Glow Crystals + more than average Gold Coins.  *personally never 
done this*  Though... now that I think about it, you might need a 
mirror piece or two for it.

If you try to get fancy with the above Draining recipe, and feel 
confident about your tempering abilities, you may as well try 
AsianGrinch Uber Recipe via Mirrored Pieces.  Final Essence values 
would end up 15/15/14/14/15/7/15/7.  It seriously cuts down on "raw" 
materials at the expence of using about 15+ mirrored pieces.  *have 
done this*

*Disclaimer* All numbers are based off the Material of AltenaAlloy

The problem with Wisp and Shade is that only Shade and Wisp CARDS 
which are NEWER than the Wizard Cards are affected by the Wizard 
Cards.  Otherwise they're normal.
If you were to drain Shade with Wisp, if Shade was level 6 before, 
you'd now have:
10 * 2^5 + 10 * 2^4 + 10 * 2^3 + 10 * 2^2 + 10 * 2^1 + 10 * 2^0
= 10 * 32 + 10 * 16 + 10 * 8 + 10 * 4 + 10 * 2 + 10
= 320 + 160 + 80 + 40 + 20 + 10
= 630 energy.

You won't be able to drain Shade just by adding Wisp - you'll have 
to drain Shade by having Wisp GREATER than Shade, and then adding 
EITHER Shade or Wisp.

If Wisp and Shade are both 6, then I'm fairly certain it's 
impossible, without draining, to raise Shade to 7.
Raising Shade to 7 is only possible with at least two Wizard Cards 
(with two Wizard Cards, it requires 192 energy, which can be 
obtained from a Nymph of Dawn Card).
However, that means you're stuck with three Cards - two Wizard Cards 
and a Shade Card.  That leaves you with only one more spot to work 
with - the leaving card, since it can either be Mirrored World (to 
allow Shade to drain Wisp) or Nymph of Dawn (to give energy).  If 
you pick the former, you won't be able to raise Shade anyway, due to 
the lack of energy.  If the latter, you won't be able to raise Shade 
due to the conflict.
So, unless you can manage to drain something into Shade that allows 
you to raise it to 7 using only one Wizard Card (384 energy 
required), you're probably stuck.

If you raise Salamander (or anything on the lower row, really) to 6, 
you can do it.

If Sala is at 6, you'd just add:
Mirror Piece
Mercury
Shade Silver
Gnome Gold

So, when you add the Gnome Gold, Sala drains to 5 and gives off (10 
* 2^5) 320 energy.  Adding the 64 from the Gnome Gold itself, that's 
384 energy, which is promptly used on Shade, which then drains Wisp 
to 0 for 630 energy, which is used to raise Gnome to 1 (:P) and 
wasted.
Then you'd have 0/7/0/0/5/1/0/0

Also, you can do this:
Mirror Piece
Mercury
Shade Silver
Lilipod / Glow Crystal / something else
Gnome Gold

That way, when you add your next item, Salamander won't drain any 
more (the top way had it draining next time, too, which would be a 
waste).

Where Could I find the recipe?  I checked the files section and it
isn't there unless you mean that dragonscales recipe
(15-15-14-15-9-15-9-15).
Or the doirwood recipe(15-15-14-14-7-15-9-15).  I would like to see
the best possible altena alloy recipe (since all the resistances are
at 10).

Damn I sure wish the game had something like 'quick temper' where you
can just temper w/o the extra graphics and you would see your item and
stats after each step.  It takes like almost a minute just to temper
one thing in and then look at your item; nevermind trying to figure
out the next step(s)!

There was also no way I could have figured out how to temper without
the internet.  The LOM guide strat guide in america is almost
worthless when it comes to tempering (and a few other things too)! 
There is also several errors in their lists of items, weapons, etc.

No such recipe has been written out.  My AltenaAlloy Spear 
(Longinus) I made was kinda my initiation into tempering in knowing 
how it works and why it did.  Taking all the scraps of information I 
found Marcus' Faq, everything that Myst said about using Drain 
Energy to raise MORE than just one Essence level, etc...

While I've never used the DragonScale recipe, I'd imagine its 
essiently the same thing thing when you start the draining process.

But here's what to do to get started

Dryad => 9, Aura => 9, Any Bottom Essence => 9 (just 1)

Once thats done, the real fun begins.  If you can figure out what to 
do from there, pat yourself on the back ;)

The basic idea though is to Drain Dryad/Aura/Bottom Essence off each 
other in such a way, that'll you'll get all 3 to 15.  While raising 
Shade and Wisp only when absolute necessary.

With the Essence Values you have on your weapon now, this won't be 
possible because Shade/Wisp are too high for the manipulation.

Keep 2 save files.  The original save file before you do ANY 
tempering, and the Save file that you use while you Temper.

Also, you might want to have a 3rd completely new file (different 
hero name) up to the point where you have access to Prof. Bombs 
Workshop.  Where you can sell items to other players for the Dupe 
Trick so you don't have to play LoM completely through 5 times to 
get all the necessary mirror pieces.

Works like this.

Original Save: Create Weapon, Do Tempering etc...

Temp Save: Save all your tempering process here, when outta 
materials that are hard to come by, go to Prof Bomb and put your 
Weapon up for Sale.

New Save: Purchase the Weapon from Prof Bomb, then sell it back to 
him, Save your Game in your Temp Save Spot.

Original Save: Purchase your weapon from Prof. Bomb and you have all 
your 2ndary materials to use all over again.  This also includes the 
Primary Material you used to initially make the weapon (like 
DiorWood and DragonScales so long as you didn't save over Original 
after you made the weapon)

If you get very serious about tempering, this is practically a must 
have :)

This too is off-topic, but.. hopefully it may be useful..
I think this list may be the target of a spam-bot. Those messages... No 
human being could possibly be stupid enough to write them. It had to have 
been some kind of AI...
I'm not sure how to change that though.. maybe there is some kind of spam 
protection that would catch messages of that variety.

The equipment in the english version of the game was weakened 
somewhat. The people who made the guide either didn't know or didn't 
care when they copied the info from the japanese guide.

Due to the recent influx of huge amounts of spam, I've made posting 
privileges members-only temporarily.  That is all.

There are some rare Items that are hard to find in the game (example
'ash')  

Maybe one of these can "store" released energy... If you could store a
drained essence's energy into the first slot with a card then release
it when it leaves the last slot, (like a nymph of dawn leaving gives
192)  then wouldn't it be possible to level up those last few essences
to 15?

For example only, lets PRETEND that 'STORECRYS' is the item:

So we drain dryad and store it into STORECRYS

---   STORECRYS   GARLICCROWN
---   ---------   STORECRYS
---   ---------   -----------
---   ---------   -----------

Then (with the stats being 15/15/14/15/15/9/15/9) we release it into
Undine for 2 essence levels:

GARLICCROWN   UNDINESILVER   CHAOSCRYS      UNDINESILVER
STORECRYS     KING           UNDINE         ANCIENTMOON
-----------   STORECRYS      KING           UNDINE
-----------   ------------   STORECRYS      KING  (STORECRYS leaves)

When STORECRYS leaves it would level up undine 2 levels.
15/15/14/15/15/9/15/11

Wouldn't it be nice?  To get Undine from 14 to 15 all you need to do
is throw in the appropriate wizard card:

UNDINESILVER
ANCIENTMOON
WIZARDCARD
KING   (STORECRYS)

If my technique isn't quite accurate I'm sorry I haven't perfected it
yet but I think you get the Idea.  The idea is that you can get the
energy from a consumption as use it while an ancientmoon is in play so
you can level conflicting essences.

I will experiment.  If this isn't true, I believe there HAS to be a
way to max all levels otherwise why would they stop the levels at 15?
 Also this system is too complex for there NOT to be a way to get all
of the essences to 15.

There is no such item - all energy is discarded at the end of the 
tempering step.

Why can they go to 15?  Two reasons.  First, that's easiest to 
represent in the mechanics.  0 to 15 is actually 16 
different 'states' which is a half-byte of code.  This makes storing 
all eight essences in a row very easy, only taking up four bytes.

Secondly, you can raise any essence you want to, up to 15, pretty 
much.  You can easily raise a lower-row essence up to 15, and you 
can pick and choose which upper-row essences to get up to 15.  
Generally, raising the other lower-row essence involves complicated 
draining processes in the upper rows, where one level is drained to 
raise two different essences, but that leaves you short one point on 
one.  15/15/15/14/15/9/15/9.  The 9's are there due to conflicts - 
you can't raise them up without Ancient Moon, and you can't drain 
anything when Ancient Moon is there, so you'll never have enough 
energy to get past 9.  The 14 is there because in order to have 
raised Wisp and Salamander/Jinn to 15, you'll have had to drain 
something (in this case, Aura) from 15->14.  So you could probably 
have fiddled with it to make it Dryad, instead, but you really don't 
have much more options than that.

Thats the beauty of my idea.  If you could have another card like
nymph of dawn but instead of just having 192 exit when it leaves it
instead is X where X = total amount of energy released while 'Card' is
in slot1/2/3.  With wisp/shade at 14/15, as 'Card' comes into slot1,
consume dryad using garliccrown then apply ancient moon then play
undine when 'Card' leaves slot3 (like nymph of dawn, but with much
more energy released!)  With ancient moon active, there will be no
conflict and undine would rise.

Its just an idea as to how to break the conflict barrier and get all
of em to 14/15 (at the same time and maybe one day all at 15.)

Of course there may not be a way to do it like you say but unless the
people who made the game told you that there was no way to do it, it
might be possible.  I have tested with 'volcano'(ASH) and came up
empty handed though but it was worth a try.

I think i'll try out 'enticed nymph'(LILIPODS) and maybe a few more. 
There could be some hidden ability no one has discovered yet on one of
the maiden cards (or other cards.)  After all there are a hell of a
lot of items to test with thats for sure.

Thanks for your quick response.

ALSO anyone try to get mialead to 15/15/15/14/15/X/15/X? 
Where X<=9 (since as of now (or maybe ever) there is no way to raise
em beyond conflict)
I haven't even touched mialead yet.

I have the actual dump of the LoM Forge Code in the Files section.  
There is no such thing - you don't need to test.

MaiaLead can probably get to... Hmmm, let's see... 
15/15/15/15/15/5/5/5....  Perhaps.  But it's basically pointless, due 
to the Growth Control of FORTY-EIGHT >_> That means you need 48 
essence points for a 2x multiplier, and 96 for a 3x multiplier.  That 
there is 90, which is a LOT for MaiaLead, and it's hardly even a 3x 
multiplier... >_>

You can't drain dryad when wisp and shade are equal. Even if there 
were this card (which there undoubtedly isn't) I don't think you 
could raise the total above 107.

I've just got the Heshishorin (for those who doesn't know, the
strongest sword in SaGa Frintier 2, and an easter egg in LoM; it is an
Altenna Alloy 2H Sword) and I don't have a clue on how to temper it.
In fact, I don't know how to temper anything, and I don't want to
screw up such a powerful sword just for tests... Can someone post a
full recipe for me to temper it, or at least tell me where to get it?
I'd be very grateful. Remember, I want to make it as powerful as
possible, so I can make it deserve its name!

Then you should get some Diorwood, Forge a 2hander Sword, name it 
Heshishorin...

Seriously,  the moment you temper ONE item into Heshishorin, it'll 
revert back to a normal AltenaAlloy 2hSword losing any base bonuses 
it came with (and even that isn't a huge loss).

Crash Course in Tempering:  Attack power is determined by the TOTAL 
essence values (wisp through undine), so your first goal is to get 
them as high as possible (total essence acts like an overall 
multplier to the overall attack power)).  Once thats done, you can 
do anything extra (plunges, stat boosters) then add a Varnish 
(manipulations of the Material attack values, more effective with 
higher essence values).

Go to gamefaqs and read Marcus' tempering FAQ.  Then read it again.

If you kicked ass in algebra, you will probably get tempering easily.

Resistance Level * 2 ^ Current Essence Level = Energy Needed to Raise

So if the resistance level was 10, and the current essence level was 
3 it would be

10*2^3 = 80 Energy

Basically the Essence won't raise again till you direct an items 
energy into the Essence.  In this case, it would take a Glow Crystal 
since it holds 96 energy.

Go here for a list of all items and their Energy Values.

http://www.geocities.com/xo_pitseleh/lom2.html 

Bottom of this page shows the energy required for the first 9 Levels 
of Essence.

http://www.geocities.com/xo_pitseleh/lom4.html

(same list is in Marcus' Faq)

...

Actually, now that I look at those numbers, they're SOOO inaccurate 
at some parts its not even funny... So just use the above formula.  
Though the table there will give you the basic idea on how the 
Essence values increase.

Here's a list of Mystic Cards and what they do

http://www.geocities.com/xo_pitseleh/lom3.html

For the most part, these are fairly accurate with maybe 1 or 2 
mistakes.  (description for Moth Wing should say +50% to magic d for 
example)

There's also the Force Code.txt on this sight in the files section 
which is totally accurate, its just that the above web sight are 
easier on the eyes :)

Just curious. What's the best armor you can get and still be able to 
regenerate and revive?

Dragonscale armor with an evil god card and yggdrasil. Use 
dragonblood or toadstoolsheds to get stats up to +20. Just be sure 
not to use needle(ttuce) or springana.
Then use an adamantite pendant and a mantle or ring. Recipes for the 
last few things are listed at the end of the armor.txt file.

**RIDDLE**
Chumpy made a dragonscale armor like the one described above. What is 
the fewest number of dragonblood/toadstoolsheds he could have used?

Considering you can use Metropolis + Clown to raise your Bonuses to 
+12 with a Yggdrasil Card, you'd just have:

(Leviathan)Yggdrasil/Clown/Metropolis
with +12 all,

Then simply go:

(---)/Leviathan/Yggdrasil/Clown

And add two Dragon's Blood.  That's +15, then +20 all.  Ta da!

That would end up +15 to all... not 20

Due to bonuses order, meh.  Go with:

(Metropolis)Clown/Yggdrasil/Metropolis
And then
(Leviathan)Metropolis/Clown/Metropolis
And then
(Yggdrasil)Leviathan/Metropolis/Clown (-1 all)
And then
(---)Yggdrasil/Leviathan/Metropolis
And then add three Dragon's Blood.

Three'd be the minimum, I suppose, due to the fact that item bonuses 
get applied first, and then cards from right to left (bottom to 
top)...

Really, two will get you two +20, it's just that it goes back down 
to +15 immediately after because it <i>should</i> be getting to a 
little MORE than +20, and then fall back down to +20...

You don't use it as a code.  It IS the code, put into English.

Simply read it - it's there for reference.  ^_^

I have allowed anyone to post messages again.

I assume that the spam-folks are done with our group, so it's open

Unfortunately, Yahoo won't let me let anyone look at the Files - 
only Members can do that, no matter what I choose...  So I think I 
will posting messages that contain the same contents as many of the 
more-important text files, sometime.  Or, someone else can do that!

Just make the subject "File: _____" replacing the blank with the 
file name, and then just post the contents of the file.

^_^

Thanks!  Hope everything goes smoothly.

Sincerely,
JC "Myst Erik Ery" D

You must allow your game to 'see' a Saga Frontier 2 saved game, by 
going to a Save or Load screen (for example, a Save Statue's 'Save') 
and choosing a Memory Card Slot that has the Saga Frontier 2 saved 
game on it.  After that, when you defeat Deathbringer II, you'll get 
it automatically.

DragonScaleArmor and AdamantitePendants are the "best" armor because
they have the highest values for material and equipment type.
Pendants also allow you to get all of the status immunities on a
single item.

1. Max armor values
Great high defense, but you can't regenerate hp.
  DragonScaleArmor 98/98/99/6
    round seed
    3 needle(ttuce)
    sleepy eye
  AdamantitePendant 0/0/0/95
    stinky breath
    fire stone
    sulpher
    sulpher
    holy water
    zombie claw
    blackened Bat
    ghost howl
    sharp claw
    water stone
    fishy fruit
    squalphin
    round seed
    3 needle(ttuce)
    moth wing

2. High armor values
Pretty much the same as the first one but uses heaven scales card
from springana so you can regenerate hp (even while moving), but
now you can't revive.
  DragonScaleArmor 65/65/68/4
    round seed
    2 needle(ttuce)
    springana
    sleepy eye
  AdamantitePendant 0/0/0/78
    stinky breath
    fire stone
    sulpher
    sulpher
    holy water
    zombie claw
    blackened Bat
    ghost howl
    sharp claw
    water stone
    fishy fruit
    squalphin
    round seed
    2 needle(ttuce)
    springana
    moth wing

3. High stats
With a maxed out hp stat you'll regenerate damage faster than you can
take it in most situations. This setup also raises your luck more than
the others can. Since the armor values aren't critical to this setup
you can make the first three items out of anything (the shoes show 
what
needs to change to work on wood). The pendant recipe relies on the
particular resistances of adamantite in a number of places, but it can
be replaced with menos bronze and any other material with the same
resistances.

This isn't a very good walkthrough yet because a lot of it won't make 
sense if this
is your first time through the game, but I'll work on that.

Maybe you will ave to reformat your map... This, Like many forums, 
override many spaces and merge them into one. But since this letter 
type is monospaced, this can be easily solved.

It's not an item drop.  Ensure you've a Saga Frontier Save File.

You can always check your inventory after the fight.

It's just an AltenaAlloy 2HSword, after all.  Not much special.

There is a cardless tempering recipe floating around that uses 
Flaming Quills and other things found early. You can make a faily 
strong weapon using that. Some of the armor recipes here consist of 
easy to get items. Go to Gamefaqs.com and read the tempering guide 
there to get the gist (sp?) of the whole process and you'll start to 
understand how things work.

Yes; I realize that I'M asking for someone else to do all the work 
for me, but... Well, I'm lazy, and have no time to think while 
having Univserity so much.  >_>  School makes JC something something.

Anyway.

Here's what I need:  A recipe for CursedBone...
(Resistances 9/5/9/7/9/7/9/7)...
To reach EXACTLY 99 ESSENSE POINTS.

Doesn't matter about the material usage, but try to keep Mirror 
Piece losses as low as possible, of course - and try to use 
purchaseable or easy-to-get materials (ie meats), if you can, as 
opposed to rare things like Moth Wings or Electricity which I 
probably don't have much of.  ^_^

Final Essence numbers themselves don't matter, so long as the final 
total is 99.

It should be fairly easy, since it has a nice 9/7 thing going on 
(high and low resistance, making for nice draining).

Thanks a bunch, if someone can do this for me :P

I'll probably be working on it in my spare time, too, to come up 
with something that works nicely enough.  But if someone else gets 
it done first, that'd be perfectly fine, hehe!

Sincerely,
JC

Subject: Raising armor (mantle) defense
X-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=163805348
X-Yahoo-Profile: darkenesis

Well I have a little grasp in the ways of smithing weapons.  Recently 
(and FINALLY) got a hold of a little DiorWood.  After raising offense 
by essence levels, I capped my spear out with 
Bumpkin/Bumpkin/Bumpkin/Sharp Claw, and now it's sitting at 862 
offense.  Not too shabby.  Something I can most certainly live with.

However, my eyes hurt and it's quite late, and I did search a bit, 
and read up a bit, but I'm so gone right now.

Here's my dilemma.  I am wearing some DragonScaleArmor with 
65/65/68/4 defenses (I did the Needle/Needle/Springanana cap so it'd 
have high defense, but also the ability to regenerate.  My HP is 
capped out, so I enjoy regenning like a madman).  Currently I'm using 
my aptly named GigaRibbon (AdamantitePendant, 0/0/0/34, +20 all, 
immunities vs all, element defenses vs all) because well... It's just 
nuts on the stat and immunity bonuses.  And for the last piece, I 
have a re-created ForbiddenRing (Adamantite, 1/0/2/23 with minor stat 
boosts, but the ability to share xp).

Well, eventually I won't need to equip the ring because my Land 
Dragon will eventually be 99, and after raising various pets, I find 
I enjoy Land Dragons due to their breath weapon which causes 
Flameburst (the Sky Dragon's Freeze breath weapon is nice, but you 
can't continue doing damage when they're frosty'd, so I quickly 
dropped him after the hundredth time of having to wait the 10 seconds 
or however long for them to thaw).

So then I'm stuck with 66/65/70/61 armor values.  Not bad, but could 
be better.  Seeing how I'm wearing a full suit of armor, not much in 
the way of equipment I can create seeing how armor negates the use of 
many pieces of armor.

So I have one main question per se.  How does one raise base defense 
values *WITHOUT* the Bed of Thorns card?  With the spear, you simply 
raise the element essences up as high as you can, then cap it off 
with x3 Bumpkins and a Sharp Claw, and it's attack value sky 
rockets.  Not the case with armor...  I did some trial run essence 
raising, but that had no impact on the defense values what so ever.

I used DragonSkin for my Mantle material.  Partially because I have a 
ton from farming DragonScales, and partially because Aroma Oil gives 
+50% to Strike/Slash/Pierce values, and only works on Hide 
materials.  The starting defenses for a plain old DragonSkinMantle 
are 4/1/2/6.  I went Oblong Seed (for the Dryad essence) then Needle, 
Needle, Needle, Needle.  Armor values are 14/5/8/21.  Put in an Aroma 
Oil, and it's up to 15/8/13/21.  That's the highest I've been able to 
get the values on my DragonSkinMantle up to.  Bed of Thorns and Aroma 
Oil work off %'s...  Is there any way to permanently raise the 
defense values on armor (mantles more specifically) without the Bed 
of Thorns card and Aroma Oil?  Give the base defense a boost so that 
the Bed of Thorns and Aroma Oil give higher defense yields?

And here's a little 'sub' question.  I've thought about making the 
98/98/99/6 DragonScalesArmor suit, but then the pendant only gives 
0/0/0/34.  I'd be sitting at 98/98/99/40.  I suppose I could make a 
0/0/0/95 pendant, but I'd have no way to regenerate.  One conclusion 
was to make a mantle with the Nymph of the Sky card on it to override 
the no regen from the Bed of Thorns (how I got to being set on making 
a mantle in the first place), but then how could I possibly squeeze 
off 59+ magic defense in a mantle when the highest I could make was 
21?  Hehe.

So then in a way, the two questions correlate, and I'm sure I'm 
rambling like an idiot.  (It's been a very long day, and I'm quite 
tired at the moment).  If anyone can understand my tired-speak novel 
I just wrote, and may have some insight as to a fix on how to raise 
armor's base defense before the Bed of Thorns card and Aroma Oil, I'd 
appreciate any help I can get  ;)

You already wouldn't.  Having 'No HP Regen' on ANY of your armors 
causes you to stop regenerating HP at all.

Yes, that means that 98/98/99/6 Armor will cause you to not 
regenerate any more, at all.

However, do note that you can always (a) use a Sword with the 
Vampsword Plunge Attack, (b) use Elysia the Succubus for her 
Synchro, (c) use a Lizardon for its Synchro, or (d) use a Candy 
Machine Golem.  That will allow you to heal even without automatic 
HP regeneration.

Needle/Needle/Springanana/Sleepy Eye.  2 Bed of Thorns improve the 
defense, Heaven's Scale counteracts the no regen attribute of the 
BoT's.

However... Just had an epiphany...

Well, didn't quite work out.  Heaven's Scale card *WILL* allow you to 
regenerate, but it takes away your ability to revive.  (Way I see it, 
if I'm down, no way in hell any pet or golem will survive long enough 
for me to get back up...)

But, however, it only appears to work for armor.  I made the 
98/98/99/6 DragonScaleArmor that had no regeneration flagged on it, 
then made a 0/0/0/78 AdamantitePendant that was finished with 2 Bed 
of Thorns and a Heaven's Scale.  Theory was that the Heaven's Scale 
card would overwrite the no regen effect regardless, but it wasn't 
working on a pendant.  So sad too, because 98/98/99/99 w/regenning 
would be pretty damn sweet.

Oh well, 65/65/68/99 is good enough I suppose.  Honestly can't 
remember the last time my hit points dropped below 90%, because with 
a maxxed HP stat, you regen like a mofo.

You say:

"But, however, it only appears to work for armor. I made the
98/98/99/6 DragonScaleArmor that had no regeneration flagged on it,
then made a 0/0/0/78 AdamantitePendant that was finished with 2 Bed
of Thorns and a Heaven's Scale. Theory was that the Heaven's Scale
card would overwrite the no regen effect regardless, but it wasn't
working on a pendant."

Heaven's Scale works for all armor.  It's simply an Effect that 
allows you to restore HP even while moving, but at the cost of 
losing the ability to Revive after you die.

However, if you still have the Bed of Thorn Effect ON ANY ARMOR, 
your HP Regeneration Rate is 0.  So, Heaven's Scale was working - it 
was letting you regenerate HP while moving.  However, you were 
regenerating 0 HP at those times, because of Bed of Thorn.

You must not have the Bed of Thorn effect on ANY of your armors if 
you want to regenerate ANY HP.

On Mantles, you can also use the Nymph of Sky, which is better than 
Heaven's Scale, because it allows HP regeneration without the No-
Revive Penalty.
On Rings and Pendants, you have a variety of different options.  So 
long as you don't end up with the No-HP Regen Effect, you'll be fine.

So you have to go Bed of Thorn / Bed of Thorn / Heaven's Scale on 
ALL of your armor, or you won't regenerate any HP at all...

Man, I so win at life for continuing to talk to myself in my own 
topic.

80/80/80/61 with +20 to all, all elemental defenses and essence 
markers, immunity vs all status abnormalities, and the ability to 
regenerate.

I went and looked at armor and material attributes.  And for plain 
ol' raw defense values, DragonScales makes the best base magic 
defense values.  So made a mantle (3rd in base magic defense values 
of armor created, but it does give +strikes/slashes/thrusts too).  x4 
Needles and capped with a Creepy Eye, overall stats the mantle gives 
is 15/15/12/23.  The ForbiddenRing2.0 I'm wearing is 0/0/0/23, so 
definately happy to get some extra defense in melee situations 
without compromising magic defense from a new piece.

Man... I shoulda spent another day thinking on it.  Now I look like 
an idiot.  :P

Hmm... Well not all, but on the one's where there is a Bed of Thorns 
present.  The mantle I just made killed my regen.  Whereas the ring 
and pendant I'm wearing have no Bed of Thorns on them.  Meh, that's 
gonna kill some of the already low stats on the mantle.

Ok, little revision.  I finished the mantle off with a 
Needle/Needle/Springanana/Creepy Eye.  It's now 10/10/8/15, and gives 
the ability to regenerate.

Hate being dependant upon pets and golems, which is why I don't go 
with Elysia or the candy machine golem.  And too stubborn to give up 
my spear  :P

Well, yeah.  You can also have any other Effect other than Bed of 
Thorn's on your armor, too.  So long as none of your armors have the 
Bed of Thorn effect.

I think 14/14/14/15/12/9/12/9 would work.
Consume 9s to get 12s and 12s to get 14/15s.

Why cursedbone and 99?

According to my calculations, a CursedBone Hammer (similar to the 
ones the Cursed Dolls drop) with 99 Essences and varnished for Force 
(rather than Heavy; I've no idea why I figured it out THAT way) will 
have 666 attack power.

99 Essences is also quite a nice number, so I left it at that (since 
then if I really wanted, I could boost the attack power quite a bit 
by varnishing for Heavy, ne?).

:D

If I'm using the formulas right then force->heavy would only give you 
a 10 point increase.

I hate to say it now, but you may find that a Nymph of the Sky would 
partially make up for the lack of Bed of Thorn cards on your armor ^^;

Some people are still set to 'Moderate Me!' status, which would be 
from WAY WAY back before I realized that having everyone on Moderate 
status would force me to manually approve ever message.  For a 
while, the group was set to "Moderation: New Members"... I was under 
the assumption that after a few posts, it'd stop moderating 
everyone, but I guess not.

Hence, a great delay is sometimes found as to when you post 
something, and when it gets posted - if this is the case, it's my 
fault >_> I didn't see the little thing on the side that said '1 
Pending Messages' and so, it never got through.

I can set people back to being unmoderated, but I have to find you 
in the Members list >_> And if I can't find you in the Members list, 
I can't change your moderation status.  So, if you encounter this 
problem, please mail me directly and tell me the Yahoo ID or Email 
Address that you have in the Members list.  ^_^

Then I can fix the problem.  (There's just too many people still 
on 'moderate' to go through and change them all at once >_< ).

Sincerely,
JC Myst Erik Ery

Hey guys

Been a long time since I caught the temper bug, and I finally got 
some insperation again via Sweet Revenge, a NemesisRock 2hander Axe.

I'm trying to repeat what Terence did with an Aerolite recipe but I 
kinda hit a wall.

My current Essence Values are

15-15-15-15-15-0-15-0

I'm trying to figure out a way to start raising Gnome, but hitting a 
lot of walls.  Such things like, can't get sufficient energy to 
Gnome without lowering Sala, or can't keep Gnome up when Ancient 
Moon goes away etc...

What I find amazing about this recipe though... it by far is the 
cheapest thing I've ever done so far... I've already used over 60 
meats!

I haven't really looked into the idea of raising Undine first... but 
I know exactly what to do when I do want to raise it... (I think 
*laff*)

I'm just hoping I didn't make a mistake by maxing out my top 
essences already.

I need a good recipe for a 75-120 attack power sword. I need 
something better than a VizelGold 2H Sword. I need something short 
and sweet. I have LorimarIron and GranzSteel and WendelSilver and 
maybe even some more.

Wooo

Answered my own question after a little playing around :) :) :)

NemesisRock 2hander Axe

Final Essence Values

15-15-15-15-13-13-15-14

Total Essence: 115!

Attack Power: 999

Bonus to stats: +9 to all

(Before Varnish essences were at 15-15-15-15-15-13-15-14)

I used a Varnish of 2x Volcano's, 1x Clown + Scissors

Recipe Consisted of about

33x Firestones *8250 Lucre
9x Earthstones *2250 Lucre
1x Windstone *250 Lucre
14x Spiny Carrots
1x Any Seed
1x Aura Silver
2x Shade Silvers
1x Wisp Silver
28x Sulphers *8400 Lucre
63x Meat (probably wasted a few)
6x Chaos Crystals *30000 Lucre
1x Bumpkin
2x Ash's
1x Scissor
7x Toadstoolsheds (just for the stat boosts)
3x Lucky Clovers *3000 Lucre (probably not neccessary, but used to
boost Gnome to 4 initially)

Total Lucre Cost: 52150 

No Glow Crystals were Harmed in the making of this weapon :D

The only thing I'm bummed out about was the fact I completely forgot
about the Treefeller Plunge. The easiest time to get the plunge
would be at the very beginning... get Gnome to 4 and add the
Leviathan card. Proceed to Focus on Sala from there. I might just
go and redo the whole thing just to get it, but oh well :) :)

The BiellaRock CrimsonGlare would only hit 907 attack power with
this recipe, much to my disappointment :/

Slightly improved Recipe,

Now attains 116 total essences instead of 115

15-15-15-15-13-14-15-14

Something new and fun to try I think :)

Chumpy found two different ways of varnishing his GeausTearGloves 
which both gave the same attack power. No other varnish could give 
better results. What were the two varnishes?

And if you want to check your answer or are wondering where how I 
made the tables, here is a sample program.

Why have you listed Gold Clover in with Spade Basil / Rhinoloupe / 
Wicked Eye?

Gold Clover is WeapHeavy 125%, not a WeapSharp 125%

As far as the best varnish for a GaeusTears Glove, the best I'm 
getting is 2 Volcano Cards and a Cleric Card, topped with Dragons 
Breath..  And that's only getting me something like 57 attack power?  
Meh.  Can't do math at 5:00 am, so I'll try it again tomorrow.

Oddly enough, I find a VinekRock 2HAxe varnished with 4x Force+50% 
Tech-50%, with zero essenses, to have 129 Attack Power.  Not 105...

?  *tilts his head to the side*

How did *you* get those attack powers?

By the way, that's just according to my calculations >_> I'll test 
it as soon as I get my third Ash.

And I've just tested it.  VinekRock 2H-Axe with 0 Essences, 
varnished by simply adding:
3x Ash
1x Lilipods
1x Scissors

And it's got 129 Attack Power.

Oddly enough, you saw the 105 on the AnkhRock..

The only saving grace is that VinekRock says 124 instead of 129 for 
0 essences

I had VinekRock as 30,22,43,48 instead of 30,22,45,48.
There might be other transcription errors. I posted the code if 
anyone feels like checking.

It will get to 63. You have to keep in mind the weapon properties as 
well as the material properties. Since tech is more than double force 
those volcano cards might not be the right way to go.

Just go with what the Forge Code says.  Then you're always right.

Also, I've found that 3x Cleric + 1x Dragon Breath gives me 63 
attack power, but I've not found any other combination.

Hint: the three clerics are right in both cases.

The first is 3x Cleric + 1x Dragon Breath, while the other is 3x 
Cleric + 1x Clear Feather.

(And I got that without the hint >_> It's kind of obvious that it's 
three clerics, since the only other Card with a "beneficial" effect 
(ie not obviously detrimental) is Volcano, which, as was said, ends 
up worse, since Gloves' Tech is more than twice its Force.)

*points to Join This Group! link upper right corner*

Made a dummy account just for kicks, clicked the above link, got 
access in less than 15 secs.  No personal info was asked.  Simply 
whether or not I wanted Posts/Notifications E-Mailed to me (I chose 
no), or if I wanted posts viewed in HTML format.  (in other words, 
don't think this place is "select" members only)

Also, you can "leave" the group at any time by hitting the 
newly "Leave Group" link under membership

Seriously... Its in your best interest to join the group if only to 
have access to the Files Section.  Recipe's for all sorts of 
materials (Aerolites, Dragonscales, Diorwood (old and new)), Quick 
Recipes, Material stats + Growth Control.  And the ever Important 
Forge Code, which lays out the rules of tempering for all to see.

ANYWAY

Asiangrinch's Uber recipe for DragonScales and Diorwood uses Dryad, 
Aura, 1 Bottom Essence to drain off each other till they're all 15.  
Then proceed to raise the non-conflicting essences by passing the 15 
back and forth between Dryad/Aura while using the extra energy to 
raise something else.

Another "trick" is to Drain an Essence, lower the cost to raise 
the "Drained" essence, put the energy back into that essence, and 
use the rest of the energy to raise something else.  Aerolites are 
the greatest example of this since Sala is always draining, though 
the trick can still easily be pulled off with Wood materials.  Only 
works with Bottom essences.

Biquts already mentioned Cardless tempering (generally, good weapons 
that can be made in less than 30 minutes).

DiorWood reaches 15/15/15/15/15/9/12/9 for a total of 105 Essenses..

> So ummm... Who wants to play around with the GigasFlail <_<

I would, but, honestly, there's no point.  -_- It not only sucks, but 
has terrible Growth Control, so any essenses you DO manage to get 
don't help at all.  Sigh.  I might look into it, though.  :) I've 
always been interested in uber-Maia-Lead.  And who knows?  Maybe you 
can use a whole crapload of Mirror Pieces to drain one thing to 
another just like on Uberrecipes, and such, and thus raise something 
up to 15 or so :P

Look right above it :p  I marked it, just felt the need to mention 
both.  Especially since the 105 isn't really necessary less you're 
making a 1H sword

I thought you were stating DiorWood as being an exception or 
something, since you did say you were posting the maximum essense 
values for each material... :P
If you wanted to include the maximum for any given 
recipe.... .... .... >_> Heh, heh.

I'd have just left it at 105, even though the Uberrecipe doesn't 
reach it.  It's not the UBEREST recipe, but it works perfectly fine 
for most weapons, besides 1HSword and the Dragonscales-weapons.

Yeah well, I feel the need to give this AsianGrinch (though I was 
never around during his time) props for making that original 
recipe.  If I do no less it probably would be considered Blasphemy

2 wizards and a tower(?) would lower resistance to 8, so NoD + a 
gold coin could get you to level 6. Replace a wizard with a chaos 
will get to 5.
15/15/14/14/15/5/15/5 would probably be the highest possible, but 
there are probably quite a few reasons why that wouldn't work out.
So 98, but totally not worth it.

Cardless gets to 3/3/3/3/3/2/3/2=22

Ok, so i know that giving your polter box gold clovers wont work 
because making its luck go up only goes into affect if it kills the 
opponent, but what about personality?  I want my polter box to be 
lonely so that it will stand next to me in battle, but the only 
produce that seems to gain lonelyness only is boarmelon.  I dont know 
what seeds to give to trent to make them grow, i've tried four big 
seeds since it is a green family product but that doesnt seem to grow 
them. Is it because of the mana levels of my home or what?  Also, ive 
fed it other fruits to make it lonely but it still says that it 
doesnt have any particular personality when i pet it.  Do i have to 
leave it in the barn, or let it graze. Im confused with this, so any 
help is good help at this point

If I recall correctly, Squalphins also add Friendly and Lonely, and 
are easier to get than Boarmelons.

For produce/seed combinations, please see:
http://www.geocities.com/xo_pitseleh/lom.html
And choose the section on produce.

Save your game, and then add three Squalphins to your Polterbox's 
feed box, and immediately go out and pet your Polterbox.  If he's 
Lonely, yay.  If not, reload your save and try again.  Personalities 
are granted the instant you put the food in the feed box, rather 
than when they level up, and so you can just keep resetting until 
you actually get the personality (or not, if you want to feed them 
something that would ordinarily give a personality that you don't 
want).

That isn't possible, because Tower requires 0 Jinn and Wisp > 0.  You 
wouldn't be able to raise Shade much.

You can only get to 18 Resistance with two Wizard Cards (that is, 
when raising Shade at first or when raising Jinn at the end.

I believe you can get 4, tops, with 18 Resistance, and that's using 
Nymph of Dawn, too.

Hmm...  If you raise Shade and Wisp to 1, to start with, so you can 
raise Dryad and Aura and stuff...  Hmm... I dunno.
It might get to... uhh... 14/4/14/14/5/15/5/15 ?  I dunno... Kinda 
not worth it.  >_>  With 86 total essenses, that's still not even 3x 
attack power... >_<

Was looking over my Max Essence.txt file (tempted to post it in 
Files)

When I noticed a mistake with Judd Hemp

With the resistance of 10-6-6-10-10-7-7-6

There's no way Dryad can put out enough energy to raise both Aura to 
15 as well Wisp to 14.

So... guess the new max would be

13-15-14-15-15-9-15-9, 105

I've been working on it a bit and got it up to 97.
14/15/14/15/5/15/4/15
I'll post the recipe once I get it typed up.
With 97 its still pretty useless, but its nice to know the max, and 
its a "fun" exercise.

I think I ran into a similar problem with the lead.
Just raising wisp to 14 by draining sala (before raising jinn).

Well, as the title says, I'm trying not to get angry with myself... 
I've been around here for some time now, and I read the files, the 
posts, etc., but I don't seem to get ANYTHING about tempering... Ok, 
I can follow the recipes, but I want to go and make some of my own, 
even if only to show my dog and hear him bark in disaproval (sp?)... 
Maybe I am too lazy, but can you make me a tutorial with the basics 
of the basics? And, no, I'm not so lazy as not to have searched for 
it, I went to gamefaqs already but... I can't quite get what they 
say! Can you be... Newb-friendly? (ok, I'm not THAT newb, I already 
did all the quests in the game, but I don't think it is over... 
Well, you got what I mean.)

Sorry for all the whining! Couldnt quite help it ^_^

If you're ever on Yahoo Messenger, you can message me (tagged_jc) or 
if you want, contact me over AIM (Myst Erik Ery).  I can help you 
with understanding the basics of tempering in that kind of 
environment best.

However, if not, I can do my best to explain some things here... ...

In any case, one suggestion is to play with things and see what 
happens when you add certain things.  Once you figure things out a 
bit, try looking at recipes and try to figure out how they work, and 
why they work.

Sincerely,
JC

The chart (varnish.txt) shows you the best varnish for every 
material and weapon.

Let's say you made a DiorWood Axe.  Now, how would you varnish it 
for best results?

Well, look at the chart. DiorWood Axe is listed as 3336.

Above the chart, it says that 3 = Volcano Card, and 6 = Dragon's 
Breath item.

So, you'd temper in three Ash (to make the Volcano Cards) and finish 
off with a Dragon's Breath item.

If you did this with 0 essenses (and somehow kept Dryad at 0, 
considering we're dealing with a Wood), you'd have 115 Attack 
Power.  If you raised your essenses up to 105 (the maximum for 
DiorWood), you'd end up with 1325 (or 999) attack power.  Woo!

The chart is just there to show you what varnish to use, to make 
your attack power the highest.

Hey, thx a lot JC (for the other topic too!). I don't have neither 
Yahoo Messenger nor AIM, but I was already planning doing accounts 
for me on both, and that just made my decision more final. If you 
only had ICQ or MSN... Well, thx, I'll play a bit later. (Well, I 
won't have much time now, since I just got into College, but I 
expect that to be this way only for a week or two, only for the time 
I need to get used to it) I guess I'll lose a bit of material, but 
hey, you gotta do it wrong sometimes to know how to do it perfectly! 
Uh... Sorry if my post was... Difficult to understand!

Until next time,
Larkas

A Yahoo ID is free, and then you can use the Yahoo Java Messenger to 
chat without even having to download the full version.

And you can always make a separate save to play with stuff ^_^

JC

I like that Table of Contents.  Mind if I take it, and write a huge 
FAQ with it?

There's a couple things missing, though:

> IV. Attribute Raising
> __1. Attribute Ranges
> ____A. Mystic Cards

B. Items --- some items give temporary Limitations.  In addition, 
there are things called 'Bonus Limitations' or special Minimum 
Limitations that some Mystic Cards have.  An example of this is the 
+15 that an Evil God Card gives.  They really do give -1 All, it's 
just that there's a new minimum for one stat.


The other thing is a section just on Mystic Cards and how they 
work.  Dealing with Essense Requirements, and the Invisible Slot.

More than welcome to go with it.  Kinda surprised I remembered that 
much on what needed to be covered.

Only other thing I forgot about were Essence Markers.

Tag those in Essence Raising.

So Chumpy was working on his GigasFlail and managed to get his 
essences to
0-14-14-15-14-0-0-0
He cleared the cards by adding 4 lilipods, then after adding 6 more 
items he had raised shade to 15.
What were the 6 items?

Hint: One of the items was a mirror piece, but he only used that to 
confuse you.

The cards present on the item before adding 4 Lilipods were as 
follows:
(Nymph of Dawn)
Wisp
[doesn't really matter]
Mirrored World

The Mirrored World is there because at this moment, Wisp remains at 
0.  It is very difficult (ie. impossible unless Shade uses up ALL of 
the energy with a Shade Card, which is unlikely at this point) to get 
a Wisp Card without having enough energy for Wisp to raise to 1, so 
having the effects of Mirrored World prevents Wisp from raising, 
allowing the conditions presented at the time of adding the four 
Lilipods.

As the four Lilipods are added, this is what happens:
First: Mirrored World leaves.  Unfortunately, there's not enough 
energy in the Lilipods to raise Wisp to 1.
Second: Nymph of Dawn leaves prematurely due to Lilipods giving a low 
energy.  Wisp raises to 1.
Third: Nothing special.
Fourth: Nothing special.

After that, the following items are added:
1. Shade Silver = (Shade)EN/EN/EN
2. Mirror Piece = (MW)Shade/EN/EN (Note that Mirrored World still 
isn't in effect yet)
3. Rocket Papaya = (Tower)MW/Shade/EN (At this point, Wisp drains to 
zero, due to there being a Shade TP and Mirrored World present)
4. Mercury = (Witch)Tower/MW/Shade
5. Shade Silver = (Shade)Witch/Tower/MW
6. Earth Stone = (Gnome)Shade/Witch/Tower

Upon adding the Earth Stone, which has a Gnome taint, Sala drains, 
due to Mirrored World still being in effect, from 14 to 13, releasing 
262144 energy (32 * 2^13).  Meanwhile, Shade resistance has dropped 
to 16 (32/2, due to the Tower+Witch combination).  Shade requires 
262144 energy (16 * 2^14) to raise to 15.  Well, what do you know?  
That's exactly how much energy you got from Salamander!  Shade raises 
to 15.  Earth Stone doesn't add enough energy to raise Gnome to 1, so 
it remains at 0, which is fine.

Ending Essenses: 0/15/14/15/14/0/0/0

My only question is how he got to 0/14/14/15/14/0/0/0 in the first 
place.  ^___^

Sincerely,
JC

The NoD would have to be before the wisp card otherwise wisp 
wouldn't rise. But thats not really what I was going for.
None of the cards present before the lilipods matter.

Hint: You don't need a tower card to pull this off.

Eew, true.  Stupid Wisp.  ~_~

Anyway, I'll think about it some more.  :P  If none of the cards 
before matter, that helps a little.  Only have to figure out three 
items, basically.
Of the six, one is a Mirror Piece, one is definitely a Mercury, and 
one is definitely a Shade Silver/Gold.
Since I'm fairly certain you'll want to have 18 resistance instead 
of 24, that implies another Mercury.

That's two items, other than those, to help get something drained 
properly.  Mind you, that means something must go from 15 to 14, and 
that'd be Aura.  However, Aura would be the one to drain Dryad.

Thus, I think we're going to drain Aura to Dryad under Mirrored 
World, and then drain Dryad to Shade.

It could go nicer, if I had one more item I could use (preserving 
Aura would be nice), but...

Items to add:

1 Mirror Piece = (MW)EN/EN/EN
1 Non-Spiny Seed (Dryad=15, Aura=14) = (Dr)MW/EN/EN
1 Mercury (Aura=13) = (W)Dr/MW/EN
1 Mercury (Aura=12) = (W)W/Dr/MW
1 Shade Silver = (S)W/W/Dr
1 Aura Silver (Shade=15, Dryad=14, Aura=13?) = (Au)S/W/W

Actually, now that I think of it, the Mercury isn't entirely 
necessary, is it?  Since you're draining from something that's at 
15, to something that's at 14 and wanting to go to 15, which has the 
same resistance.  I suppose it's okay.  :)

I'm pretty sure this will work.

ACK!! don't drain the aura/dryad.

To make it a little more clear what this hint meant, Chumpy could 
have used a grave dirt instead of the mirror piece.

If you need more help try looking at the recipe. This part of the 
recipe has been left out, but the ending essences are pretty 
revealing.

So it's just so the next card-making item doesn't push the cards in.
However, I don't quite see how you can drain Sala two levels and 
raise Shade one..  Unless things can drain multiple times, which I 
didn't think they could.. O_o;

Otherwise, you'd need Tower.  Since 32*2^13 < 18*2^24 (since it's 
36*2^13).  With Tower, 14->13 can raise 14->15, however...

But...  You said no Tower.  And thus, minimum Shade Resistance would 
be 18.  Which means you can't just drain Sala into Shade.

Unless I'm missing something and you can somehow drain Sala twice in 
a single step..  Does that happen with multiple Undine taints?

Meh.  No time to think right now.  Working on ANTH homework.  *gasp*

Maybe I should let someone else try? :D I keep getting them all 
myself... Heh heh.

Oh, by the way.  I realized earlier that Tower has two DIFFERENT 
requirements - one is Jinn=0 Wisp>0 (Healing Claw), and the other is 
Sala=0 Wisp>0 (Rocket Papaya).  Is this useful to you?

I'll name that riddle answer in *5* items.

Um... yeah.

Anyways.

Firestone
Waterstone
Mercury
Shade Silver
Waterstone

'course, you can do it in 3 without the 'don't drain Aura/Dryad' 
restriction that got added late :P  (Mirror Piece, Shade Silver, Non-
Spiny Seed)  Name the restrictions in the riddle next time, huh?

 ---

Quick explanation on how the above works:

Firestone: Adds Sala card and TP: (Sala)/EntN/EntN/EntN
TP doesn't do anything, of course.

Waterstone: Adds Undine card and TP: (Undine)/Sala/EntN/EntN
Undine TP drains Sala, but the Sala TP takes it all back.

Mercury: Adds Witch card: (Witch)/Undine/Sala/EntN
Undine drain and Sala reraise occurs again.  Nothing special.  Undine 
doesn't get to raise at all yet because of the lack of energy.

Shade Silver: Adds Shade card and TP: (Shade)/Witch/Undine/Sala
Undine drain and Sala reraise occurs YET again.  However this time, 
the Shade Silver allows Undine to raise a level after Sala returns to 
L14.

Waterstone: Adds Undine card and TP: (Undine)/Shade/Witch/Undine
Sala TP vanishes, but we don't care.  Didn't matter either ways.  
*Two* Undine TPs drop Sala by two levels, releasing 393216 energy, 
and the Witch card before the Shade drops Shade Resistance to 24.  
393216 is thus *exactly* what's needed to get Shade to 15, so... up 
it goes.  Undine also has enough energy to raise to L2 afterwards.

Final essense totals: 0/15/14/15/12/0/0/2

Guess you could play with it to get the 6 items the riddle asked for 
and utilise the hint to its intended effect... but eh.  Too 
bothersome.

Slight mistake; had it right in my original try to post, but a discon 
ate it and I misremembered when reposting.  Undine doesn't have 
enough energy to raise (could've if a coin was used, but that's 
another story), so final total will be: 0/15/14/15/12/0/0/1

That can't be right. I used rockets in my recipe and sala wasn't at 
zero.

That's because Myst has it the wrong way around.  Healing Claws are 
Sala=0/Wisp>0, Rocket Papayas are Jinn=0/Wisp>0.

Sweet! Very nice energy management, better than mine. 

When I first made the recipe I used

chaos crystal
lilipod
undine silver
mercury
shade silver
fishy fruit

But the lilipod could have been any carded item so I gave the hint 
about the mirror piece to be specific.

chaos
undine
mercury
shade
mirror
fishy

I didn't even think about using stones.
I posted this as a riddle because it was the hardest step for me to 
work out. Its also made me think there are probably a few places I 
could save a mirror piece by using a spiny carrot instead of a fishy 
fruit.

Shade TPs are dealt with before Sala TPs...

Thus, Sala drains one level, from 15 to 14, and has energy released 
directly to Shade, who goes from 14 to 15.  At this point Undine 
raises to 1, due to the Shade Silver's energy.

At least, that's as far as I know...  Item Wisp/Shade TPs are dealt 
with after draining, right?  I hate Wisp and Shade.  So evil.

>_>

And yes, I suppose I mixed up the two (Healing Claw and Rocket 
Papaya), but Tower STILL has two different essense requirements.  
Just check Forge Code.

Only Aerolite draining can possibly occur before the Tempered Item's 
properties are done.  And the Tempered Item's special properties are 
done before *any* Card on the item.  Draining occurs immediately when 
called by *any* special effect, while raising only happens 
immediately for Wisp and Shade (which is why they're "evil").

And Sala's still at L14 at that time.  So, what happens is (skipping 
a few non-relevant parts):

1. 48 energy in the bank, Shade Silver is looked at, Shade card put 
into PreHidden slot, not enough energy to raise a level so nothing 
happens.

2. Push in the cards: (Shade)/Witch/Undine/Sala

3. Go through the cards from top to bottom, so Enticed Nymph first, 
which has no effects when in the Pushed Off slot, so we dump it.

4. We still have 48 energy and Sala isn't in conflict (Undine's at 
0), so we flag Sala to *attempt* to raise.  Not enough energy yet to 
actually do a raise, but that's where the deferral comes in.

5. Undine TP triggers a Sala drain, releasing 262144 energy.  We've 
got more than enough energy to flag Undine to attempt to raise, defer 
to end as usual.

6. Witch drops Undine and Shade resistances to 24 (among other 
elements).

7. Elemental raising!  Out of the two we've flagged, Sala takes 
priority.  262192 energy in the bank, more than enough to push Sala 
back up to 14.  We have 48 energy left.

8. Undine.  It was at 0 until now, but 48 (plus an unneeded reduction 
to 24 Resistance) is all it takes to bring it up to 1.  NEXT TURN, 
SALA WILL BE IN CONFLICT... but it's alright, because we got Sala to 
survive long enough anyways.  (And we need the second Undine TP on 
the card list *BEFORE* the Shade, because of deferral stuff... gotta 
love it)

That explain it satisfactorily?

*doesn't even read the lower portion* >_> I already get it :P

I just needed to refresh my memory, and wake up.  Being up all night 
drains you.  Lots.

>_> >_> >_>

Anyway, yeah.  Draining happens the moment a TP is found which 
allows a drain, so you *can* drain before raising the tempered item, 
obviously (as when you add an Undine Silver to something with 
Salamander).  Of course, normally the energy just builds up waiting, 
but if it's Shade or Wisp, the Raising is used right away, if able, 
and doesn't wait for more draining.

Isn't it a little sad how draining Shade from 14 to 0 doesn't give 
enough energy to raise Wisp from 14 to 15? :P

Anyway, yeah.  I understand, I'm just sleepy and brain-fried.  
Gooooooo ANTH!!!!  >_<

*sobs*

Anyway, do we really have an uberrecipe for MaiaLead now?  Is that 
actually the maximum possible, do you think?

How much suckage would your equipment suck if your equipment sucked 
of MaiaLead? ^_^

No, what's sad is that the same Wisp taint that drains Shade can't 
even make use of *any* energy released by Shade ^_^;  Otherwise, you 
could *just* about do it by making use of the energy from the 
Tempered Item as well.

Have to have two Wisp Taints, more's the pity.

Of course, that's a theoretical statement, and we can be grateful 
that there's really no call to even think about doing this sorta 
thing, since getting Shade to drain kinda requires Wisp to be greater 
already.  I can think of one theoretical setup where you can see the 
difference, but... why or how would you ever get there?

Yes, Maybe. The 4 15s and 2 14s can't be improved and I don't see 
any way to improve the 4 and 5. But there might be some way to 
rearrange things to get a higher total. Remember we used to think 
104 was the max for diorwood.

The flail would be 173. =_=

I'm looking for a non-uber DiorWood recipe. I need 84 essences to be
exact. I am aware how lazy it is to ask this here and not just figure
it out myself but I figure the worst that could happen is no one helps
me. :p

P.S. Hi JC, now I can annoy you on TWO websites. XD

Why?
Short on mirror pieces?
An 84 non mirror piece recipe will very likely be longer than the 104 
uber recipe.

I think I have like 4 or 5 Mirror Pieces. It's only my 3rd time
through the game and I haven't gone for perfection on any of those runs :p
It's no big deal really. It just seems like overkill to make a 2HSword
with the uber recipe. This is especially true since my goal is every
possible 999 weapon. I could be using those Mirror Pieces on harder
things to max like the Bow. I'll probably just rush through a couple
times and get all the Mirror Pieces. I need Ash anyway. Thanks for
replying.

I think I already asked this, but how do you use the forge code? You 
read it or should it run like a program? (heh, I may be wrong, but 
back in the days I programmed with Visual Studio, I used codes very 
much like that :) )

If it was made for reading, could you explain it to me and exemplify?

Thanks, and sorry for all the trouble!

So I was working on my diorwood 105 recipe and might have come up 
with a way to get to 106.

If a way can be found to get to:
14 15 14 15 15 0 0 0

then

3 eyes
mirror
lilipod
3 holy water
2 mercury
wind stone
garlicrown

many times will raise jinn to 15.

But I can't figure out a way to get to 14/15/14/15/15/0/0/0, so I'm 
going to finish work on my 105. Maybe someone else will come up with 
something.

Well lets see

get to

14-14-15-15-15-0-0-0

Then

Here's the part I'm unsure about

Cards

<Fishy Fruit>
Sulpher
Sala
Shade

Would the energy released from Wisp => go into Sala to bring it back 
up to 15? *if* that were to happen

12-15-15-15-15-0-0-0

And just drain Dryad once to get 14-15-14-15-15-0-0-0

But that kinda hard to rely on since I've never actually done 
Wisp/Shade Drain Manegement :/

First, Shade won't drain Wisp unless under Mirrored World.  Second, 
if it does, Wisp drains TO ZERO.  Third, it can't anyway, unless it's 
higher than Wisp. ^_^

You simply can't use Wisp and Shade for draining purposes... It's 
pointless.. :)

You need to drain Dryad, but you can't, since Wisp=Shade.

Gee you tossed out that idea fast :P

Minor Mistake, but the idea remains the same.

We have

14-14-15-15-15-0-0-0

<Earth Stone>
Sulpher
Sala
Shade
Mirror World --> Leaving

Earth Stone Drains Sala from 15 -> 14

10*2^14 = 163840

Gets directed into Shade

163840 - 8*2^14 = 32768 Energy Left

Shade goes to 15, Wisp to 0

Here comes the part I'm unsure about, so I refer to the forge code.

5E8E - Wisp/Shade Consumption
If Active World Card != Ancient Moon Then:
If Active World Card != Mirrored World Then:
If Wisp EssLv > Shade EssLv Then:
While Shade EssLv > 0:
Call Reduce Shade
WEnd
End If
Else If Shade EssLv > Wisp EssLv Then:
While Wisp EssLv > 0:
Call Reduce Wisp
WEnd
End If
End If
End Sub

5DAE - Reduce Wisp
Decrease Wisp EssLv by 1 --> Energy
End Sub
5DBE - Reduce Shade
Decrease Shade EssLv by 1 --> Energy

If I read that correctly, there should be an ADDITIONAL 114681
Energy on top of 32768. Would that Energy direct itself back into
Salamander to raise it to 15. Salamander certainly isn't consider
in Conflict yet till the next temper turn anyway so it CAN raise of
the energy is there.

Which should at the time only require 6*2^14 = 98304 energy to get
back to 15.

After all that

0-15-15-15-15-0-0-0 would be the supposed essence if the above
worked.

Which point you'd Raise Wisp to 9, Jinn to 12, Undine enough to
Drain it into Wisp making Wisp 12, Drain Dryad ONCE to make Wisp 14.

Which point results would end up

14-15-14-15-15-0-12-0

I know I celebrate early at times, but I believe that this will 
work.  Did a Test run.

Essences

4-4-9-0-5-0-0-0 (raised Dryad high enough so it wouldn't interfere 
with the test)

Goal is to raise shade to 5 using Draining but Sala must remain 5

added in

Mirror Piece
Shade Silver
Fire Stone
Sulpher
Earth Stone

Cards

<Earth Stone>
Sulpher
Sala
Shade
--> Mirror World Leaves

Earth Stone Drains Sala

10*2^4 = 160 Energy

Shade Raises to 5 using 128 energy

32 Energy Left, Wisp Drains to 0 (7*2^4) - 7 Energy is added making 
our total now 137

Gnome raises to 1 using up 3 energy (134)

Sala required 6*2^4 = 96 Energy to raise Leaving 38 Energy, (plus 
the original 32 from the Earth Stone, but didn't want to use that in 
the calculations, wanted to make sure that everything could rise 
with just draining energy alone)

Final results

0-5-9-0-5-1-0-0

Does ANYONE seen any possiblity that I may of MIS-CALCULATED and 
would not work in the 14's and 15's.

However those WERE the final essences after my test and thus gives 
me hope that the Diorwood formula has been improved yet again :)

Biquts, you're a genious ;)

Apply the same thing to

14-14-15-15-15-0-0-0

If you're asking whether Wisp's draining to 0 is cumulative, it is.

Wisp draining from 14 to 0 on DiorWood would give out 114681 energy.

I knew that much :p

I just had no idea of the Energy would actually go back into 
Salamander and it did :)

Thus Shade/Wisp Drain Management is NOT Pointless as you put it ;)

Well, of course it goes into Salamander.

You can drain **Salamander** to raise Salamander, even.

Energy is generally released long before it gets to a Taining Point, 
excepting Wisp and Shade as they're dealt with as they come.

The only reason I said it was pointless was because it's a bit of a 
waste to drain something from 14 to 0.  It's especially sad how 
draining it from 14 to 0 STILL doesn't give enough energy to raise 
something to 15, without a Wizard Card, at equal essenses, without a 
bit of help from the item's energy.

This is because the sum of energy from 1 to 13 is just a little short 
of the energy from 13 to 14.  And you need twice the energy it took 
from 13 to 14 to get from 14 to 15.  So it's just really sad, how 13 
consecutive drained levels gives just about as much energy as one 
drained level, but not even that much.

^_^ Now, if 106 is possible on DiorWood, then is it possible on all 
Woods?  In any case, 106 would grant 999 Attack Power 1HSwords, too, 
wouldn't it.

That just makes Staffs, Gloves, and Knucks unable to reach the 
maximum, and the latter two have 0's in their multipliers so it's not 
a huge surprise, whereas Staffs... well... have really terrible 
weapon attributes >_<

:D

Just hit the 0-15-15-15-15-0-0-0 mark  with that I know you can make 
it to 14-15-14-15-15-0-0-0.  I think its almost pretty safe to say 
the Diorwood formula has been improved "again" *laff*  Heading to 
bed and finishing it sometime later.

Good job Biqut :)

Indeed
Here are my item totals. I'll post the recipe monday or tuesday.

1 wisp gold
1 shade gold
1 aura gold
1 dryad gold
1 gnome gold
1 undine gold
19 wisp silver
10 shade silver
3 aura silver
1 sala silver
2 gnome silver
1 jinn silver
2 undine silver
35 firestone
11 earthstone
8 windstone
1 water stone
3 sun crystal
3 moon crystal
81 glow crystal
12 chaos crystal
22 garlicrown
13 spiny carrot
1 lilipod
11 fish meat
22 sleepy eye (any pixie producer)
22 holy water
51 mercury
68 sulpher
18 mirror piece

I think that ends up shorter than the 105 recipe I have posted, and 
only 2 mirror pieces more than the 104 recipe.

Chumpy is working on that newfangled diorwood recipe and came upon an 
interesting cycle. Starting at

0/1/9/1/9/0/0/0

he added 9 items and ended at

0/1/10/1/10/0/0/0

What items did he add?


Bonus: Chumpy got to 0/1/9/1/9/0/0/0 using only 23 items. Can you 
figure out what they were? or do better???

Can you possibly cut down those Mirror Pieces at all?

With 16, you have to beat the game three times (and get all the 
Mirror Pieces each time), but with 18, you have to beat it one MORE 
time...

Yes
6 are used to go from 0/1/9/1/9/0/0/0 to 0/1/15/1/15/0/0/0.
With extra consumptions you could start at 0/1/11/1/11/0/0/0 and 
save 2.

And the last mirror is used to go from 14/15/14/15/15/9/15/9 to 
15/15/14/14/15/9/15/9 so it isn't needed.

Hey! I gave tempering a try, but i have some questions. Could you
help me?

1-What is Mercury and Sulpher for?
2-Where can I find Spiny Seeds?
3-I put in 3 coins (like Sala Silver), one Glow Crystal, another
coin (or any other thing. What I want is to push the Nymph of Dawn
card out) and the corresponding mana stone after that (in the case,
a Fire Stone). This way I get 5 essences. Isn't there any faster way
to do that?
4-Let's suppose I have 5 Undine and want to raise Salamander and
drain Undine completely. What I did was use 3 Wind Stones, 3 Earth
Stones and 2 or 3 Fire Stones (can't remember the exact number here,
and can't rememebr if I used something BETWEEN the different stone
types, but I think not.). Good, I got Undine to 0, as I intended,
but I could only raise Salamander to 3 (I think that I lost some
energy, using your terms ^_^). Isn't there any more efficient way to 
do
that (specially because I wanted to have the God of Destruction
plunge, so I needed 5 Salamander), or at least a faster way? (If
you're askin why I did this, I wanted to have Vampsword AND Flame
Tongue in the same weapon, only after I did all this I saw I
couldnt, but hey, it was a good experience!)
5-I added the Flame Tongue plunge to my sword, great, but when I
went and tried it on, it looked like a regular uppercut attack to
me. Is that right?
6-Some cards, like the Wolf, doesn't show any picture in my game. Is
that right?
7-Hey!!! Where the hell did that plunge table go???

Thanks for all your time!

> 1-What is Mercury and Sulpher for?

They create wizard cards which lower resistances, which then allows 
you to get to higher essence levels with the same energy.


> 2-Where can I find Spiny Seeds?

Lullabuds, malboros and shrieknips will drop them. Treant gives them 
out randomly, and since I usually don't need more than two thats fast 
enough.

Most likely. It depends on the material which way is best. Cardless 
tempering will get to 5s even with high resists and only uses one of 
each coin.

Using a mirror piece would be faster, because salamander drains 
undine under mirrored world, but don't waste your mirror pieces on 
that. Once you understand how to use wizard cards getting a 5 is very 
easy, so don't worry about the efficiency.

Yes

Yes and no. Its like that in everyones game, but I wish they made art 
for it.

Yep

So without the 15 cap woods and aerolites could get infinitely strong.
Is that true of all materials?

Thx, biquts! Btw, the number 7 was not answered... Anyone knows 
where it went?

Now I have one more doubt. I'm still trying to do a really strong 
Altena Alloy 2HSword (Heishishorin), but I have no clue on how to 
raise essences above a certain level (9, I think). I know you may 
say it is not worth all the trouble, and you are right! But I'm 
crazy, and I want to do it :). My main problem lies in Wisp/Shade 
realtions. They seem so... Unstable. And please, try to keep your 
essences as low on Mirror Pieces as possible! Thanks in advance!

I'm not sure what you mean by 'Plunge Table'.

You could go to http://www.geocities.com/xo_pitseleh/lom.html and 
choose 'Tempering for Bonus Effects and Plunges', though.

Raising Essenses above 9 requires consumptions.  You can only get to 
11 on High-Resistance ordinarily, since you have to drain another 
essense which must raise in conflict.
So, here's an example.  Raise Salamander to 9.  Now, under Ancient 
Moon, raise Gnome to 7.  Now, with three Wizard Cards present, drain 
Gnome with Salamander.  Salamander 10!  Now, raise Gnome up to 7 
again.  Drain Gnome with Salamander again.  Salamander 11!  
Unfortunately, I think this is the limit, if you're doing it this 
way...

With Wisp and Shade, the main thing to remember is that ordinarily, 
if Wisp > 0, then Shade can't rise.  If Wisp > Shade, then adding 
either Wisp OR Shade will cause Shade to drain away to 0.

Really, a 7/7/9/9/9/7/9/7 Heishishorin would probably be quite 
powerful anyway, although metal swords SUCK TERRIBLY >_>;;;

Well, I meant a plunge table that was in the database section. It 
showed the plunges, how to get them and which regular plunges it 
ovewrites... there was one, wasn't it? If not, man, I'm crazier than 
I thought... o.O

Hahahaha, I'm doing worst that I thought... I can't even seem to 
raise Shade above 6!!! AltenaAlloy's resistance is WAAAAAY too high. 
But, hey, if someone else managed to temper MaiaLead, why can't I 
temper Alloy? ^_^ I'll keep on trying! Can I drain any essence into 
Shade?

Try imagining a man with an AltenaFelt Spear beating an entire army 
armed with AltenaAlloy swords.

AltenaFelt Spear = 999 Attack Power.
AltenaAlloy Sword = 591 Attack Power (739 as 2H Sword)

I currently have a DragonScale Sword, with an attack power of 100.   Is
it possible to increase the attack power?  If so, what do temper it with
to increase it?  Will this work for my IshePlatinum Spear (currently
with an attack power of 70)?

Mush-in-a-Boxes do nothing for pets.  Gold Clovers, however, WILL 
raise Luck.

However, Luck is completely useless on a Polterbox.  Luck is only 
useful when that character kills something, and you don't want your 
Polterbox killing things.  It's you who wants to be killing things, 
while in Synchro with the Polterbox

I was wondering... Ok, let's suppose I was able to get my Salamander

Chaos Crystals to make Gnome go up to 7. Then, I drain Gnome to 
Sala. Ok. Great. I think I can get Sala up to 11 this way, right? 
But how the hell do I max it out? (15)??? Other question: can I 
drain, like, Sala into Shade or Wisp? I'm asking this because of 
something I read earlier: you can drain 14 Shade directly to 0 and 
you still won't be able to raise Wisp by one point... Is that right?

You can drain Shade from 14 to 0, and just BARELY not have enough 
for Wisp to 15.  However, if there's a single Wizard Card present, 
or you're adding an item with 8 or more energy (that is, any time), 
then you'll be able to raise Wisp.

You can redirect Sala's draining into the upper-row essenses by 
adding a Spiny Carrot (cardless, Undine essenses) while there's two 
Wizard Cards and an upper row essense card present.

Getting Sala higher than 11 or so requires you drain upper-row 
essenses to it, after you raise them up.  That's complicated, too 
complicated even for me, right now >_< , and probably uses some 
Mirror Pieces.

Your best bet is to drain Sala from 11 to 10, until you get all 
upper-row essenses to 13 (which I believe is what they can get to, 
if Sala is 11), then raise Sala and Jinn to 11, if you can, and the 
remaining two to 7...

gnome 7->6 = 10*2^6
sala 10->11 = 1*2^10 (with three wizards)
You are short by 384 which is more than NoD + gold coin can give you.

If sala was a low resist this would work because you'd only need two 
wizards and so could double drain gnome.


> But how the hell do I max it out? (15)???

Hehe, try doing it on maia lead. =_=
But seriously try looking at the uber recipes. Getting a 15 by 
multistep draining is a real pain.


> Other question: can I drain, like, Sala into Shade or Wisp?

Yes. On dragonscale, 9 in undine will give you 12s in jinn, which 
can give you a 14 in dryad, which can give you a 15 in shade...


> I'm asking this because of something I read earlier:

> to raise Wisp by one point... Is that right?

Yes and no.
If shade and wisp have the same resistance and you don't use any 
wizard cards then draining shade from 7->0 wouldn't have enough 
energy to get wisp to 8. (but you only need an item with an energy 
equal to the resistance to make up the difference)

Shade would only drain if wisp was already higher than shade. But 
with favorable resistances and proper use of wizard cards you could 
have shade 7->0 raise wisp 8->9.

Yes, increase essences then varnish.


> If so, what do temper it with to increase it?

Thats a very complicated question. There are many recipes on this 
site if you want a specific answer. Otherwise read the FAQ (MMajarra 
on GameFaqs is the best one so far...) and then ask more questions.


> Will this work for my IshePlatinum Spear (currently with an attack 
> power of 70)?

The best method of raising essences changes from one material to the 
next, but cardless tempering is generally good (QuickTemper, 
Tempering_1.0, weapon_first_walkthrough). The best varnish depends 
on material and weapon (varnish.txt).

The highest Bonus of any single piece of equipment is +20, and it's 
actually easier to obtain +20 All than it is to just get +20 Luck 
(in fact, it's impossible to have just +0/+0/+0/+0/+0/+0/+0/+20).  
So yes, there are formulas that allow a piece of equipment to raise 
your Lucky by 20...

If I get it right, varnishing is like a finishing touch to the 
weapon/armor. You make all the essence raising, plunges, etc, and 
then varnish the weapon/armor. Varnish greatly increases the 
efficiency and stats of a piece, like augumenting Slash Attacks (in 
wpns) or Defense agains them (in armr).

The varnish is the three visible cards and last item tempered.

2336

would mean 1 cleric card, 2 volcano cards and a dragons breath.

I have a file explaining the weapon formula, but I'm having trouble 
uploading it. (its a 5k file thats setting off the 5120k limit)

We've already reached the limit?  Wow!  Okay, time for me to 
download it all, and upload it to a Geocities Site.  Mind you, that 
can go Down from time to time, so I'll keep important files 
(ForgeCode, Material.txt, and stuff like that) handy..

There are three Ash in the game.

One is in the White Forest, one is in the Bone Fortress, and one is 
at Madora Beach.

You only get three per game, so use them well!

(Note that AshWood is a completely different item, and is dropped by 
Woodings - it's a Primary, and not a Secondary.)

I have a question on your weapon formula text. I dont completly 
understand what capping means, and i somewhat dont know about growth 
control. Ive read on different materials and growth control but is 
there more to it? Ive had this game since it came out but i stopped 
playin for awhile and never really fully understood some stuff about 
it.

The varnish (capping) is the three visible cards and the last item 
tempered. Each of these can change the material values. Different 
material values lead to a different (hopefully better) attack value.

Raising essences multiplies the attack value by an additional factor. 
Growth control determines how effective the essence total is. An 
essence total of 12 may double the attack power of one item, but only 
be a 25% increase on another item.

Basically its possible to max out a material stat. After its maxed 
then trying to increase it anymore won't be helpful. That is the 
usual reason when things aren't four of a kind in varnish.txt.

I'm working on a tempering program. What I have so far is gold coins 
on obsidian. (try it out and see if you can find any bugs)

Challenge: Try to get dryad to 5. =_=

Well, I haven't checked to see if resistances are correctly working, 
or energy levels, but here's how I got Dryad to 5:

Dryad Gold (Dr 1)
Dryad Gold (Dr 3)
Aura Gold (Au 1)
Aura Gold (Au 3)
Wisp Gold (Wi 1, Dr 4, Au 2)
Undine Gold (Wi 2, Dr 4, Au 2, Un 1)
Undine Gold (Wi 3, Dr 4, Au 2, Un 2)
Undine Gold (Wi 4, Dr 4, Au 2, Un 2)
Undine Gold (Wi 4, Dr 4, Au 2, Un 3)
Undine Gold (Wi 4, Dr 4, Au 2, Un 4)
Dryad Gold (Wi 4, Dr 4, Au 1, Un 4)
Jinn Gold (Wi 4, Dr 4, Ji 1, Un 4)
Jinn Gold (Wi 4, Dr 5, Ji 2, Un 2)

13 Gold Coins.

Question: What will you do when three cards leave at once?  ^_^
That is, are you going to simulate the game?  Because the game makes 
the 'leaving' animation for Sacrificed Nymphs and Pixies.

For example (Ragnarok)Pixie/Pixie/Pixie, upon adding an Odd Meat, 
becomes (---)Wings of Darkness/Beast-Headed God/Fallen Angel.
However, each Pixie leaves, too, and then the three Evil Gods 
enter.  That's a total of six card movements.  Quite a long step! ^_^

Only the thing that gets pushed into the leaving slot will be 
displayed there. The other things will just change. Though getting 
the code to spit out comments as it runs wouldn't be hard.

I've got most everything related to essences except material 
properties working. I'll post the code once thats done and I've 
tested it a bit.

Ok, its up. I've tested it on the beginings of the aerolite and 
diorwood recipes and it seems to be working. Let me know if you have 
any questions.

Now only attack/defense, stats, markers, immunities, price, plunges 
and...
Well quite a bit to do, but the framework is up.

What about when two things leave at once?

(Something)Nymph of Dawn/Something/Something

That time, a Nymph of Dawn and the last 'Something' will leave.

Unless you just count a Nymph of Dawn leaving as a 'change'.

Suggestion for useful comment outputs:
Energy of item:
Energy from draining (XXX) with (XXX):
...
Energy used by (XXX):

And of course, include an option to leave out some of those messages if you 
don't really care.

Even a thing that displays which TPs are found, and in which order (like:
TPs: Sh, Wi, Dr, Dr
In the case of (Wisp)Dryad/Dryad/Gnome and adding a Shade Silver.)
would be very interesting.
And even a message saying World Card status, like:
World Card: Bed of Thorn, Mirrored World
or
World Card: Heaven's Scale
and so on, so you can (a) see whether Mirrored World or Ancient Moon was in 
effect that step, and whether you have a World Card problem or not.
You could also display a message whenever a World Card is purged from the 
invisible slot.  ^_^

heh, heh.

Yep, the nymph_of_dawn card changes itself into a no_card if its in 
the 2nd/3rd slot and theres not enough energy.

i.e. its a card effect not a movement effect.

I've thought about that. I could have some flags for all the 
different options and change output based on that. But I'd rather not 
clutter the code too much before I finish putting in functionality.

True.  However, it would be useful code for debugging, wouldn't it?

Just include flags for each message (including the one that says 
what cards are present, and which card left) and have you able to 
set them by saying 'MESSAGE #' which toggles that message on or off.

You could just start with basic stuff, like, energy at start of 
tempering, energy at end of tempering, TPs present, and so on...  
It'd be useful for testing out whether things are working.

Oh, and, did you mention that you needed to do Bonuses, Bonus 
Limitations, and Limitations? ^_^

Maybe. If you find a bug I'll sniff it out. But at this point adding 
that code is more likely to cause a bug than find one.

Yes, and quite a few other things. Thats why pretty_print isn't high 
on the priority list. But it will probably get done at some point.

I got attack/defense modifiers working, but I'm going to clean up the 
code a bit more before I post it.

Oh and I found a couple errors in the forge code.
1. Jinn Taint shouldn't call test dryad dominance, and as far as I 
can tell it doesnt.
2. When a NoD leaves because of lack of energy it gets rid of the 
current, not the topmost NoD.

Either type or copy+paste the numbers. The <0-0-0... are what the

I would really, really like to be able to type in an item's name 
instead of a number... :P

That does have some problems for the things whose names are parts of 
another item's name, as in Needle and Needlettuce... unless you just 
don't include pattern matching at all! ^_^

No. It would be pretty easy to do. I currently grab as text anything 
that doesn't match as a number. I'd just need to loop strcmp with a 
list of item names.
But its of dubious worth to me because I'd rather type the number.

Got fixed ages ago after a report on GameFAQs.  I guess Myst put up 
the old version I originally sent out.

Not an error.  It is most certainly the "topmost" NoD; it uses the 
*same* code that the Evil Gods call when they leave and replace 
Sacrificed Nymphs.

Perhaps the definition of 'topmost' I've used in the code is slightly 
confusing... of course, considering it was mostly made for my own use 
and wasn't really tidied up, that's understandable.  For some reason, 
I like to think that you're adding the hidden card to the 'bottom' of 
the card heap, and they get pushed up, and when they reach the very 
top, they're taken off.  Kind of the reverse of stack theory... 
perhaps it should be changed to 'bottommost' to reflect LoM's 
graphical implementation and stack theory.  Eh.

I really should just release the spreadsheet program I made to 
simulate tempering in the first place sometime.

On the other hand... 'topmost active World Card' had a certain ring 
to it.  I certainly preferred it to 'bottommost active World Card'.  
Eh.  Whichever works and people will understand.

I use topmost and bottommost to refer to the in-game representation 
of the Mystic Card list, which lists them from top to bottom.  Thus, 
I assume the Invisible Slot is above this list.  ^_^

Is it possible for "topmost" to refer to anything other than the 
current pixie/NoD?

Hum maybe

(Wisp) arranged to give 0 energy
pixie
NoD
pixie

>>ancient moon>>

That might make only one EGC. I'll have to try that.

Won't work.  Leaving card is cleared (and reset to Empty Slot) 
immediately after its effects are looked at and calculated.  By the 
time it looks at the second Pixie, that Pixie will be the 'topmost' 
(or 'bottommost', if you prefer) Pixie on the item.

NoDs are a lost cause for the same reason, since they only do their 
check when they're in Slots 2 and 3, and there's no way to lose 
energy between those.  (And by the time you *get* to Slot 3, 
whatever's in the Leaving slot has vanished)

Sacrificed Nymphs are the only ones you can actually test in the game 
without hacking the cards to work differently (which is fun, but 
kinda beyond most people's capability)

I don't think thats what I meant. I want two pixies present with 
ragnarok as the active world card. And arrange things so that only 
one of the pixies sees enough energy to change into an EGC and see 
which one changes.

In-Game, I'm left with:
(---)
Pixie
---
Witch of Moon

Adding two Lilipods gives me:
(Enticed Nymph)
Enticed Nymph
Pixie
Witch of Moon

(Which answers a question I was wondering about some time ago - 
empty cards don't push! ^_^ Although, I guess that's a little 
obvious with how the Invisible Slot doesn't push when you happen to 
put World Cards in there and then destroy them...)

A little strange.  It must go from bottom to top, of course, since 
all card-things work backwards.  The first Pixie sees that there 
isn't enough energy to transform; however, it still calls the Witch 
of Moon Code (Ragnarok is the current World Card).  Then, the Nymph 
of Dawn leaves and there's plenty of energy.  The topmost Pixie then 
realizes that transformation can occur, so it replaces the 
bottommost Pixie with Witch of Moon and runs the Witch of Moon code 
herself.

Mind you, this little 'irregularity' normally wouldn't happen except 
under these very specific conditions - normally, all of them are 
able to transform, so they all just happen to transform themselves.  
And even if they don't transform, USUALLY Ragnarok is around next 
step, and since they already are acting like Witch of Moon, there's 
no difference.  Except they remain sticky for one step.  ^_^

By the way, from now on, 'topmost' shall refer to the newest Mystic 
Card present, and 'bottommost' shall refer to the oldest Mystic Card 
present.  Since that is, after all, how the game represents it.

I think I'll edit ForgeCode.txt to reflect this, if it needs it, and 
fix those other mistakes while I'm at it (and I'll change the names 
of the Pixies to their more-fitting names!).

Now only the essence levels are shown after you add an item.
To show the other info type /
To bring up the item list type ?

I think I'm going to call it done once the price code goes in.

Not handy?

Just click 'Printable Report', and you'll have a handy list of 
EVERYTHING, all on one page.  You can even sort them by price, if you 
so desire, although I'd think you put them in a list depending on 
their card #, like the Database is naturally.

Thats the problem, it is everything. I wanted something to print and 
that would have been 7 pages. I sorted by price and combined likes 
and got something that fit on less than half a page. I have things 
sorted like they appear in the forge code, so the database order 
didn't seem particularly benificial. But it did have the info I

And bug fixes, yes? ^_^; I think you've got a few problems in your
attack/defense calculation, for starters. And it crashes when I try
hitting '/' before any item is tempered in.

Not that I can talk... I've just found another bug in my own
implementation (had Peach Puppy increasing Heavy and decreasing Sharp
when it's obviously the other way around).

Would there be any complaints to me putting my own Excel spreadsheet-
based tempering program up into the Files section? It's more
restrictive on what machines it'll run on, obviously, but I'd like to
think it's slightly easier to get to grips with.

Problems with it is that, like all things, it could have the odd bug
still lurking in it (though I think I got most of them), and you
obviously need Excel to run it, and on top of that, it uses macros.
And it's like four times bigger than Calc.exe to boot. On the other
hand, it does allow a possibly quick and easy way (though confusing)
of transferring item stats and recipe lists, since it's possible to
save both into a 'code' that can be pasted in and loaded up.

Anyways, so long as it's okay (and I'm not stepping on anyone's
toes), I can put up the zip file with the two spreadsheets and the
accompanying readme file, and we can see how it goes.

Can you give an example of something that produces different results

Then don't do that. =_=
Its trying to pretty print uninitialized values. Doh.

You can cut and paste into calc.exe too. Is that what you meant?

Try looking at a Wisp Silver + Peach Puppy added to an AlteGlove, as 
a simple example.

Indeed.  But it's nice to be able to see what the starting stats of 
an item is.

Fair 'nough.  I'll try and get it up tonight.

Not entirely, though the fact that calc.exe can parse multiple 
additions in a single line *is* good.  The code I developed for it 
was more meant to help compress a recipe, so that a single step would 
be no more than 3 characters (first a two letter code for the item, 
and then a single letter code for the number of times it was added).  
On the other hand though, it's kinda confusing to debug if something 
goes wrong with it... thankfully, the proggie does decompress it to 
readable form when you enter it in and load it into the recipe area.

Eh, you'll prolly be able to see and comment on it tomorrow, anyhow.

Who taught these guys integer math? I thought it was just the

Same people who taught them how to use random numbers properly I'm 
guessing, after my exposure to FFTA's code.

My Excel proggie's up, by the way, if you want to take a look.  
Nothing really new, but probably good for comparisons.

X-Yahoo-Group-Post: public

I know mosr of you probably know this but, you can temper your 
weapons and not lose the stuff you tempered in to it by creating two 
save files with the mirror pieces and use up the pieces in one file 
than trade the weapon your tempering to the next file add the mirror 
pieces from that file and so on, you can keep copying your game in 
chains giving you unlimited of any item that you have at least one 
of.  So don't fret when you see an 18 mirror piece recipe, don't 
waste countless hours going through the game getting mirror pieces.

You can always use the Aerolite recipe which uses Zero Mirror

Well, to get Phoenix you need Jinn and Salamander to be at least 
five each.

To get the Revive Effect, you need to have a Phoenix AND a Volcano 
Card on your Ring or Pendant, without having a Phoenix Card in the 
Invisible Slot.

Well, that's easy enough.  Now, how does it work?

Okay, equip your ring.  Now, die.

If you're the last character on your side to die, your ring will 
revive you.  However, it can only do this once.  Once you've died, 
the Phoenix Card present will be removed and you'll lose the Revive 
effect forever.  If there's multiple Phoenix Cards present (that is, 
two), then one will be removed.  However, you'll still not have the 
Revive effect until you temper your item with at least one more item.

This can be a costly thing to do, since there's limited Ash each 
runthrough.

You're best to set up something where you end with:

Spiny Seed
Ash
Flaming Quill*
Grave Dirt*
Any Meat (or Grave Dirt on Woods)*

And then, once you revive, go back in and add the three items marked 
with an asterisk (*) again.

I have a dragon scale 2H Sword that has essence levels of

14/15//14/15/8/14/7/15

what formula do i need to increase these levels further.  I got the 
sword from my older brother who hasn't played it in a long time and 
forgets how to increase its essence levels.

Im guessing i'll need mirror pieces, chaos crystals, glow crystals, 
gold coins, sulpher and mercury.

You can squeeze 4 more essence points outta it to make

15/15/14/15/9/14/9/15.

You won't be able to get Gnome to 15 because it needs an Ancient 
Moon card to not be in conflict, in order to actually get the energy 
to raise Gnome to 15, you'd have to drain the 15 from Dryad/Aura.  
But since you need the Ancient Moon, you can't drain at all :)

So...

Mirror World the 15 from Aura to Dryad.

Have Wisp, Sorc, Witch cards on the weapon (at the time of the 
drain) and drain Dryad with a Garlic Crown.  Which'll make Wisp/Aura 
15

Then just do normal Ancient Moon raising of Sala/Jinn to get them to 
9.

Varnish with Ash's and Scissors and done.

So you'll need

1 Mirror Piece
3 Chaos Crystals
1 Sala Gold
1 Jinn Gold

And however many other Glow Crystals, Sulphers and Mercury's you'd 
need.

X-Yahoo-Group-Post: public

Ok I now have a 15/15/14/15/9/14/9/15 dragon scale 2H sword, I think 
th ats as high as I can get the essence levels.

If I varnish with 3 ash and scissors i get 999 attack power but the 
ash limit the amount of + to stats I can have on it

If I varnish with 3 holy water 1 dragon breath 1 giant horn and 1 
gold clover I can get the attack power to 99? basicly just short of 
999

If I varnish it with bumpkins and sharp claws I can only get to 985 
attack power.

Is there anyway I can get this to a 999 weapon without the stat 
restrictions of using ash?

And as long as the spiny seed produces a yggdrasil you won't need 
the meat.
But its better just not to die.

X-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=310445

How is essence raising done?   I have some Adamanite weapons (
Adam2HSword, Adamspear, Adamsword) that I desire to raise esence levels
from base 0 to level 6 (for Dryaid, Undine, Salamander, & Gnome) and
Attack level up as high a I can get it (currently, the attack level is a
little over 100.  Using Dragon Breath helps a little, but not that much.

To raise an essence level for Gnome, I would alter the weapon by adding
Gnome silver or gold to it?  I have not had very goon luck in altering
weapons or armor.

In order for me to get my gnome on my dragon scale weapon to 15 sala

drain an essence, besides using garlic crown for dryad draining?

Once Sala, Gnome, Jinn, Undine > 0 then you can no longer drain any 
of em.

Other than draining  Dryad/Aura, the only other possible essense you 
could drain is Wisp, and I wouldn't suggest that...

You won't be able to drain Shade
You won't be able to drain Sala
You won't be able to drain Gnome
You won't be able to drain Jinn
You won't be able to drain Undine

... with that current essense setup.

If you have a bed of throns (cannot regenerate) and a heavens scale 
(no revive but regenerate while walking) both in the armor at the 
same time what happens?  Can you only regenerate while walking?  
Does the heavens scale overide the bed of throns, but you keep the 
uber def? or does the bed of thorns keep from any regeration what so 
ever, meaning your armor is screwed because you can't regen or 
revive?

The last gnome you add in conflicts with the jinn essence and starts 
to drain it, where the steps say gnome goes up and jinn stays the 
same.  I don't know if Tagged_JC is around anymore though?  I tried 
putting in a chaos crystal to prevent the conflict  it stopped jin 
from draining but drained dryad from 4 to 5 making the stat boost 
with meats unacceptable.

I'm not sure.
You could make two diorwood 2haxes. One with max essences and the 
other with just enough to get to 999. Then try to find something that 
doesn't die in one hit from the low 999 (this might be very 
difficult), but does die from the high 999.

forbidden ring?   (a special card I think).   Will having such a

Ok I'm pretty sure about this but I just want to make sure.  Is the 
reason for getting +20 stats because you have 2 yggdrasil cards and 
each allows a +10 max across the board and together is +20?  Im 
trying to make a +20 all stat all status protectio pendent with 
quite high mdef, all though I'm sure the one in the armor.doc is the 
result of countless hours of striving for the same thing.

Is it possible to pass the glown cards through while maintaining the

of the clown cards.

*note may have to look at the recipe in the files, I was almost done 
the whole thing, only 1 bumpkin 1 fire stone than a sharp claw to 
finish, when I descided to go ash/scissors, I think you could 
maintain the sala essence while its draining until the clown cards 
are out?

When you're finished with the recipe, Salamander would be 13 if you 
did it right.  

You can probably keep Salamander at 12, but you won't be able to 
salvage it any higher than that.

Fire Stone
Fire Stone (Ancient Moon card Leaves)
Chaos Crystal (Sala Drains to 14)
Ash
Ash
Ash (Sala Drains to 13)
Fire Stone
Scissors (Sala Drains to 12)

Should still come out to be a 999 2Hand Axe.

I was gonna do 

2 fire stones
chaos crystal
2 sulpher
2 fires tones (sala 15)

Than start at the first of the gnome steps to get the cards in the 
right order, but Right now I have just added the last volcano and 
its 999 with 13 sala, and im gonna skip the scissors because for 
each lvl sala is under gnome, gnome resistant monsters take less 
damage, so I don't think it would matter :)

well after you add a Chaos Crystal after those last 2 fire stones, 
Sala goes back down to 14, then you lose 2 more in the varnish.  So 
still down to Sala 12.  Thats more work with nothing to show for 
it :)

Do both friendlyness and lonleyness make your pet stay close to you
in 
battle.  If not equal then which produces better results?

I've heard you get a 10% reduction in damage from elemental magic if 
you have the resistance marker. But the most you need is 3 in an 
essence to get the marker. So high essences are pointless unless you 
need them to produce a card.

Hye.

Off the topic, probably, but...

I've been scouring the internet for the music sheets for LoM (the 
best soundtrack in the world!). Can anyone tell me if there are any 
sites which have some? I know I saw one before, but I've absolutely 
forgotten where it was.

PleasE??

Actually I was wrong.
I was assuming cards were evaluated before the item, but thats wrong, 
and it does make a difference.

2 moon crystal
2 sun crystal
4 holy water
dragons breath (76)
clear feather (75)

So the lesson is that with integer math multiplication isn't always 
communitive.

Commutative, and that's the wrong lesson :P  If you were using simply 
integer math and only multiplication, it would be entirely 
commutative ^_^

...Well, I've done it.

You know me, or some of you do: I'm the one who made that 'Help a 
beginner' topic on the Legend of Mana board at GameFAQS.

So, this is just to say "Hi."

...How does this even work?  It mentioned about E-Mails...

...The last post on my 'Help a beginner' topic had me wondering what 
to do for non-Sharp Weapons.

Adamantite looks like it'd be best, at least for Flails and Gloves, 
which rely on Tech.  But where can you FIND such?

Also, how would you varnish such?  There's no card effect that 
increases Tech...

No.

This is a theory, but I THINK it's accurate, from what I've read.  
Can someone confirm?

With limits, the highest possible applies.  They don't combine as you 
suggest.  The Cards that give the highest limits are the cards from 
the '7 Evil Gods' set-Fallen Angel, Witch of Moon, Lord of Flies, 
Wings of Darkness, God of Destruction, Beast-Headed God, and 
Leviathan.  Their limits are -10 to +20 to stats.  Their effect on 
attributes is to raise one stat by 15, but put the rest down.

The way the recipies for stat equips work is to combine one of those 
cards with Yggdrassil, which allows items tempered in to raise stats 
as long as the card is present.  Thus allowing you to hit the maximum 
limit via items that don't produce cards, like Meat.

I think having two Yggdrassils is to double the amount tempering an 
item raises stats by.

If you're planning on raising the essences then dragonscale would 
likely be better.

It turns out varnishing for heavy is best, because there are no cards 
which increase tech.
That and a better growth control are why dragonscale is usually best.

I need a very good, probably 800+ attack power, diorwood bow formula.
Also can u give me a check list of all the items I need to make the 
bow.

There are two chess knights in the tower of leires, floor 4, right 
next to the stairs up. If you don't no already, bring a polter box 
and stand next to it when u kill the chess knight.

There's a folder in the Files section called 'DiorWood' which 
contains LOTS of DiorWood Recipes...

Have you tried looking?

The MMajarra FAQ on GameFAQs has a complete formula for a 815 
diorwood bow which includes adding plunges and the varnish.

Is it possible for the energy requirements for an item to produce a 
card to come into play on items that don't have wisp/shade TP?
I'm thinking not, but I might be missing something.

And it doesn't look like it would matter for anything but the coins 
since the wisp/shade taints come after the card checks in all the 
other items.

I saw in the files a list of the potential possible essence levels 
for all the materials.  So, I ask, how exactly does on get such 
ridiculously high essence levels as 13s, 14s, and 15s for Altena 
Alloy?

Your question has a complicated answer.

To put it simply, it's draining that gets it higher than 9.

In order to raise higher than 12ish, you have to use advanced 
draining techniques that end up draining something in order to raise 
two other things, and other strange things like that.

I really don't have an Adamantite Uberrecipe (mostly because it's 
inferior to DiorWood or Dragonscales), but since it's ALSO high 
resistance, it would probably work exactly the same as AltenaAlloy...

Its not easy. Most high level recipes revolve around getting 
dryad/aura to 15/14 as soon as possible then leeching energy as you 
slosh it back and forth with mirror pieces. For better materials that 
is just a matter of draining a 12 from the lower essences. But since 
AA is highly resistant to everything you can only directly get a 10 
on the lower essences. So usually a three pronged approach is needed 
were energy is passed between dryad/aura/sala gaining a level each 
cycle.
I have AsianGrinch's recipe for it somewhere, but I haven't posted it 
because its not worth doing. (I posted the maia lead recipe because 
noone would believe me otherwise)
Diorwood or Dragonscale are better choices for high level tempering.

Yeesh, you mean that MaiaLead recipe was made by a human?  I could 
have just imagined someone programming something like calc.exe to go 
through every single forging possibility to figure out how to 
perform such a ludicruous task.  Of course, the very notion of 
collecting 52 Rocket Papayas makes me laugh...  Has AsianGrinch 
written a faq or anything?

So, why wouldn't you want to use something like Adamantite for high 
essence levels?  Isn't it's offense power still superior to that of 
Diorwood or Dragon Scales?  I dunno, I'm just looking at 
material.txt by tagged_jc:

GC | Sh He Fo Te | St Sl Pi MD | Wi Sh Dr Au Sa Gn Ji Un
--------------------------------------------------------
20 | 62 46 93 99 | 62 31 93 62 |  8  8  8  8  8  8  8  8 | Adamantite
10 | 50 30 70 20 | 80 25 35 45 |  7  8  5  9 10  7  7  7 | DiorWood
14 | 60 66 54 54 | 72 72 60 30 |  7  7  7  7  6  7  7  7 | DragonScal

As I see it, Adamantite seems to have the best stats, and really 
only 4 more essence resistance points than DiorWood.  Or is it just 
that with Essences Maxed out like in the Uber Recipes those stats 
become essentially meaningless?  And in that case, wouldn't that 
Aeriolite recipe with the some 116 total essence points end up being 
the best material to use?

Okey dokey...  I wanted to ask you though, in your materials.txt, 
what does the "GC" abreviation mean?  And I know this is kind of a 
dumb question, but what do the next four abbreviations mean?  I can 
safely assume they represent the attack elements, but I keep on 
seeing different sets of what the attack elements are so it's kind 
of confusing trying to tell which matches up with which.

GC means Growth Control

Long story short, it determines how effective the mana levels on a 
weapon will raise its attack power.

Example

If you have a Diorwood Weapon (Growth Control 10) with a base attack 
power of 50.  Now add 10 levels of Essence to the weapon and the 
attack power will be 100.  Another 10 levels of Essence (total 20) 
and the attack power will be 150, another 10 levels... 200 attack 
power.

In Adamantites case, the growth control is 20.  Weapon with 50 
attack power, you would have to add 20 levels of essences just to 
get it to 100 attack power, another 20 to get it 150, and another 20 
to reach 200 attack power.

The exact formula used is

(Total Essences + Growth Control) / Growth Control)

So if we take a Dragonscale weapon with 42 Total Essences

(42 + 14) / 14 = 3

The base attack power will get multiplied by 3.

Its the Growth Control which makes certain materials like AltenaFelt 
so powerful when you raise their Essence Levels.

Bottom Line:

Higher Growth Control = Bad

Ekm3777 has already explained GC, but I think I'll chip in by adding that
the four attack types are Sharp, Heavy, Force, and Tech.

You can get the LoM MP3 files from kazaa, but it takes alot longer, 
thats where i got a few of em.. maybe you can get em from imesh or 
winMX too, i dont know though.

Tempering is pretty nonlinear, so a computer blindly guessing which 
way to go wouldn't go very fast.

Thats why I got a gameshark.
^_^

And its also why I wrote calc.exe, because its much easier to test 
ideas when you don't have to wait 5 seconds between items added.

wow, I have had this game forever, and I never knew that the weapon

all works, but ive got no lucki just look for easy/cheap recipes when 
I need a good weapon but sometimes I can't even follow that right. I 
praise you all as my LoM Gods for being able to max out essence 
levels and the like

Yah, its deep. But most of the work is done by a small number of 
items. (coins, sulpher/mercury, chaos/glow crystals) So once you 
understand those you can do quite a lot.

1. low level tempering
-glow recipes: these use the large amounts of energy available from 
glow crystals to get to 6s
-"quick" recipes: these use wizard cards (from mercury/sulpher) to 
lower resistances so its easy to get to 7/5s

2. mid level tempering
: this combines the above two ideas to get to 9s

3. high level tempering
: adds in consumptions to get 12s

4. ultra high level tempering
: multistep consumptions to get to 15s. more exotic items like mirror 
pieces are needed at this point

I'm fairly new to tempering weapons but I've played through the game a few times, 
and I can only seem to find one mirror piece. And I can't even remember where I got 
it. Where are mirror pieces found? I was getting ready to try out a recipe I found on 
here but then I saw it needed 19 mirror pieces! *falls over* Help? :P

Look through a walkthru and search for instances of "mirror piece", I think you can get 3 or 4 each run through the game.  Then you can "recycle" your mirror pieces (and other tempering materials) if you use the Prof. Bomb exploit:
 
You need an alternate save game file with a different name.  In that quest, you need to have found Prof. Bomb so that you can use weapons from other game files.  
 
Once that's ready, go back to your main game, and begin tempering your weapon.  SAVE before you start tempering mirror pieces, then when you've tempered your last mirror piece, save your game in a NEW SLOT, and go to Prof. Bomb & sell him the weapon you tempered the mirror pieces into.  Now, load up the alternate game file, go to Prof. Bomb, and buy the weapon that he's holding from your main file.  Now the weapon is linked to the alternate file.  Sell it back to the Prof.
 
Now load up your main game, using the slot that you saved at BEFORE spending your mirror pieces.  Go to Prof. Bomb, and buy the weapon that he's holding from the alternate file.  Now you have your weapon back in your main game.  The weapon has mirror pieces in it, but you've loaded your game at a point before you tempered the pieces - so you will still have them, as well as anything else you used in that period!
 
Repeat the trick as many times as you need to.  It's time consuming and expensive, but it still beats going through the game several times to collect all those pieces.

If you're still interested in knowing where the four Mirror Pieces 
are:
1) The Birdcage Lighthouse, Madora Beach
2) The Underworld, further down than you go during "The Fallen 
Emperor"
3) The Bejewelled City, in one of the gem rooms
4) The Mana Tree, Sanctuary of Mana

I'm wondering if anyone knows of a good FAQ regarding growing 
extremely rare produce.  I've been trying to raise a monster with 
stats and defense points maxed out as much as possible, but 
according to my formula I'm going to need almost 50 Rocket 
Papayas...  Ya, that's no fun...

I've gotten about 16 or so as it is, but I'm in at over 100 hours, 
and it'd be nice if I didn't have to spend the rest of my life 
gathering those damned fruit!  So it'd be nice to have some good 
info on growing the rarer fruits.  I've heard rumors that what day 
you plant seeds on effects what they produce (Although I'm not sure 
of how) and so far I have both the Orchards my House next to the 
Mana Tree.

As far as I know, the day and the essence level matching you the color you plant only 
makes said plants grow faster. Thats what it says here too:
http://www.rpgamer.com/games/sd/sd4/info/legend_of_mana_mastery.txt

This is a good site for seed combos to get certain produce and stuff though:
http://www.geocities.com/xo_pitseleh/lom5.html

I don't think theres any easy way to get rocket papayas though. It's the same story as

Hello! I'm new here! I've been thinking about making a blog and I had 
this really good idea of using this picture I saw at Etansel.net that 
had the female Sprite listening to the Lil' Cactus. Only problem is 
that now that I've decided to do this, the site is down or something 
is seriously wrong with it. Whatever the case I can't find that 
picture anywhere. Does anyone know what I am talking about and where 
I can find it? Thanx ^_^

Go to www.naimoka.com.  In one of the Artist sections should be the picture 
you seek.  Lots of other good artwork there too.  It's all official stuff, 
too.  You'll see what I mean.

Diorwood 106 is the name of the recipe that will get diorwood to 106 
essence.
Files/Diorwood/Diorwood106.txt


> Also what kind of sword is that 2h or 1h?

1 handed, 2 handed would get to 999.

Has anyone checked if going over 999 actually does more damage?

Look at mmarajjas faq on tempering, hes has a recipe for making a good
one with the that ability. It is the same thing just with better stats.

Yes, look in the diorwood folder.
The 104 recipe should take a bow to 999.

Cap in the same way as the mmajarra faq.

Check out Recipe_Book/armor.txt and don't use dragonscale.

Is it possible to get a single piece of armor to have 99/99/99 
defense? If so, how?

In that case anything should work. Using a pixie might cost you a few 
extra dragonbloods at the end. But it will get pushed off because 
ragnarok will turn it into an EGC. World cards wouldn't be a problem 
because they'll go away when the wicked eyes are added. Sac nymph and 
NoD wouldn't cause problems there. And neither would holy 
water/garlicrown. Those are the only ones I can think of that might 
be a problem.

What are you looking for, something simpler?

Nah, I wasnt really looking for something simpler... my friend found 
me a good combination for a mantle after I posted, but thanks a lot 
for the info on the card items.

I got mine up to about level 40 but I didnt give it a
special diet or anything.  I never saw it summon
monsters, but it wasn't leveled up much.  If you want
to be sure, I recommend feeding it produce that will
quickly get its skill and magic up to 99, also you may
have to get his level up to 90+, make sure you have
the forbidden ring in order to level him up quickly.

Nothing but scare tactics as far as I'm concerned. 
They can't do anything to you for using p2p file
sharing.  Think about how much money it would cost
them just to sue one kid who doesn't even have the
money to pay them (nor do his parents).  It would be a
waste.  Their whole scheme is to make money.  

You've probably seen alot of the recent "big brother
is watching you" style advetisements around on
websites.  All their doing is trying to scare people
into not using p2p filesharing, or particularly,
downloading content that belongs to them.

Neither the RIAA or the MPAA have any connection with
the LoM OST so there's no way you can get in any
trouble for grabbing it again off kazaa (or whatever
you feel like using).

They can't do anything to you for using p2p file
sharing.  Think about how much money it would cost
them just to sue one kid who doesn't even have the
money to pay them (nor do his parents).  It would be a
waste.  Their whole scheme is to make money.  

You've probably seen alot of the recent "big brother
is watching you" style advetisements around on
websites.  All their doing is trying to scare people
into not using p2p filesharing, or particularly,
downloading content that belongs to them.

Neither the RIAA or the MPAA have any connection with
the LoM OST so there's no way you can get in any
trouble for grabbing it again off kazaa (or whatever
you feel like using).

The name of the question kinda tells all.  I don't wanna learn the 
tempering too much so rather I just want someone to tell me the 
recipes.  All I ever see are sword, 2h sword, and bow recipes.  None 
for the knives...

Any of the uber-recipes should work just fine for knives.  Check out 
the last couple of the Dior Wood recipes, for the best knifes 
possible.

It's in the DiorWood (a historical perspective) and called 
DiorWood106.txt (so-named due to the fact that it has a total of 106 
essenses).

Then, simply finish with 4x Bumpkins + 1 Sharp Claw.. Blammo~

Sometimes spammers get ahold of our group email.  If it becomes a 
persistant problem, I set the group to Members Only, preventing them 
from mailing in, which causes their mail to bounce (so they stop 
sending it).

I would advise against replying to any spam.

Also, if you feel spam may be a problem, you can set "No Mail 
Messages" in your settings for the group, and simply check the group 
page for new messages.

I have deleted the spam messages, and I'll see if I'll need to 
temporarily Members-Only the group. :)

Sincerely,
JC "Myst Erik Ery" D

The main reason I keep this open to the public is simply because some=20
people who do not have Yahoo accounts may have questions to ask.

However, if I hear more people who agree with you in that it should=20
be Members-Only for posting, I can keep it this way.

It doesn't guarantee protection from spam, but it does mean that I=20
can simply ban any spammer from the group, effectively preventing=20
spam from its source instead of waiting for spammers to give up each=20
time.

And, of course, if someone wants to ask a question, they could GET a=20
Yahoo account, or simply look through the message archives for an=20
answer to their question.

What does anyone else think?

I'm a total troll here, but that sounds like the best answer.  I
joined after reading the posts and files, if someone is looking for
more it's not too hard to take the extra step.  After all it's free to
join yahoo.

Hi!

in the game i'm playing, i've messed the placement of Lumina (right
place, too late :-P ) and now i've got no level 2 store to buy Sulphur
and Mercury.

Since i don't want to restart, do you know which monsters drop Sulphur
and Mercury so i can do some basic tempering? (a weapon in the range
of 100-200 should be enough to finish the game, i'm not going for one
of the bigger recipes yet)

I've looked around gamefaqs and the files area, but found no table of
dropped items. I've got my Polter Box pet, however, so i can go
hunting for good items. 

Any suggestions?

Thanks in advance,

Dexter

I've tried Recipe #3 "The Full Metal Gauntlet" (located in the files
section)3 times now and it will not boost stats past +10. Also, Jinn
stays at 0 instead of going to 3.

I think there may be something wrong with this recipe.

The problem is somewhere around the second gnome silver. The gnome 
card isn't being pushed on in time to benifit from the wicked eyes.
And without a chaos crystal jinn will drain whenever the gnome card 
becomes visible.

Sadly, no monsters drop these. But you can still make decent weapons 
without them. This recipe works on dior wood and will produce 
similar results on most materials.

I've been using the Northeastern part of the map for the perfect area,
according to FDesroches and ANelson's Map Placement Guide on
http://www.gamefaqs.com, and now I'm about to place the Ancient Tablet
when I've found out that the spot's unavailable. I've spent nearly 7
hours of game time to get where I am only to find out that I can't
place the aforementioned artifact where I want to.

So, what am I doing wrong?

Have you completed at least one quest in at least one area next to the spot? 
Artifacts can't be placed next to lands that haven't had at least one quest 
completed in them.

I'm looking for the aforementioned items because I'm doing the
"Pee-Wee Birdie" quest, and I need to know what monsters drop them
after being defeated.

Thanks in advance,

Well...Undead monsters drop rotten meat, and beast monsters drop 
animal hides. I think you can buy these somewhere; I didn't have to 
leave Domina to complete it.

I've completed the game for several times,with all events completed.
But I am clueless because the monster encyclopedia is not complete.

I did research on it and found that it was Deathbringer II was the 
one I haven't defeat.So,please tell me how to get myself to fight 
Deathbringer II.

Thanks in Advance.

It's actually quite simple.  You only need to revisit the Hallway of 
Cartilage (the room where you had defeated Deathbringer the 
original) any time after defeating Jajara but before deafeating 
Drakonis (and thus clearing the Dragon Arc).  You'll see why when 
you fight him.

Well...rabites from the Luon Highway drop hides...so yeah...The bone 
fotress, jungle, and Duma Desert have a lot of undead monsters, I

There seems to be a plugin conflict on your site in Firefox. When I
visit your site it keeps asking me to install Quicktime 6.5.1. The

Hi. I recently got this game again, after about three years, and I
remember almost nothing. Is there a specific file/files I should read
on tempering in general, not specific recipes? Thanks a lot!

Subject: Re: How am I to fight Deathbringer 2?.....Can't seem to find it....

True, fighting Deathbringer 2 are not too hard to do. But... anyone 
know how can I get the 2h sword rumoured to be there after the fight 
if we had a Saga Frontier 2 save on the mem card? I got the memcard on 
Gamefaqs, copy it to my mem and try to get that 2h sword... no such 
luck. 

Now that I killed Deathbringer 2, maybe sometime in future I try 
return there to see if I got any better deal.

When you go to save your game you have to scroll down to see the file 
on the memory card before you fight DB2.

Any one got better quality versions of the pictures of the mystic cards?
I need larger sized ones than the ones in the photos folder... I'm
trying to customize my Tarot card deck and I wanted to use a few of
the mystic cards as my Major Acrana. Thanks in advance. ^_^

Hey there, I'm fairly new here (first post, yey me), just recently
been getting back into this wonderful game and trying to make myself a 
hammer using an old file-I made it from TuttleRock and the first
thing I wanted to do was give it the Mjolnir plunge attack. I checked 
the mystic card database and saw to get the attack I needed to add the 
Thunder God card using Electricity. So, I raised Wisp, Salamander,
and Jinn to... Er... I think it was 4 each, and tried to temper in some 
Electricity, but the Thunder God card refuses to appear and I can't
get my plunge attack! ;.; If anyone knows what I'm doing wrong, please
let me know. Thank you in advance!

Thunder God requires 4 Wisp, 4 Salamander, and 4 Jinn at the time you 
temper the Electricity.
Since Aerolites drain Salamander each time you temper something, 
you'll need to make sure that you do indeed have 4 Salamander when you 
temper in the Electricity.

Double-check your essense values and try again. ^_^

Sincerely,
Myst Erik Ery

but, I finally got it to work by pushing Sala. Thank you so much for 
your help!

Does anyone know if the jp version is longer? As well as if you can 
find one, if it is longer, with a english translation? Thank you.

I believe the only length-related change between versions was the removal of the Pocketstation game "Ring Ring Land". If you're interested in that, I'm afraid I can't help you find it. However, let me set your mind at ease: no plot was taken out of the English version of the actual PSX portion. All intended plot removed was removed, for time constraints, from the Japanese version as well.

5000ff01 0000 is a serial repeater code that your gameshark isn't good
enough to handle. You'll have to change the quantity bytes for each
item you want individually.

I actually find item farming in LoM to be relaxing.

There are only 4 per game, and they are only found in treasure chests.

-in the mana Sanctuary
-in Elle's cage (Not sure about this one)
-in the lower levels of the underworld in one of the rooms
-and I THINK there's one in lucemia, though I may be mistaken

In the Japanese version, it is written using Katakana :
RU SHE I ME A (Rusheimea).

This would be pronounced like "Loo-shaay-may-uh" I suppose.

I forgot to mention at the start (although the Forge Code contains 
it), this hammer is made with Fullmetal.

I was just wondering what the best way to get wicked eyes may be.  I've 
been trying to get them off beholders using a polter box but no such 
luck.  I'm going to finish the jumi quests and try the mini-game in 
domina inn to see if that's any easier.  I think wicked eye is one of 
the prizes if you score within a certain range.

still, it's upsetting that they have to make cuts at all to me.  I'm 
always amazed at the complexity of this game though, regardless.

Wicked Eyes are the Rank 8 drop from Beholders, so it's as rare as 
Dragonscales and DiorWood.  I wouldn't recommend getting them from 
Beholders.

There are two Treasure Chests with Wicked Eyes in them (one in The 
Flames and one in the Junkyard) and you can also get them from the 
Shadow Zero-One Mini-game.

That would be the best place to get them, as you only need 51-60 
Zerobees (although that might be harder to get than the maximum, 200, 
just snag a 16-pointer three times (3*16 = 48) and then an 8 pointer 
(or less).

Acid (or possibly Blackened Bat, if you have 1+ Wisp) is a substitute 
for Wicked Eye, by the way, unless you need the Wicked Eye for its 
+25% Sharp, in which case Rhinoloupe or Spade Basil could work as 
well.  Acid is dropped by Big Baby and Slimes 50% of the time (when 
with a Polterbox - they also drop Fish Meat and Morph Meat).

I hope this helps.

They removed Pocketstation support because between the time Legend of 
Mana was released in Japan and in North America, the Pocketstation was 
discontinued.

I don't know why they couldn't have just left it in there anyway, 
though.  Oh well.  No Swift Rock for me U_U

ah, thanks for the tips.  I've just gotten the Zero-One Mini-game and 
it's immensly easier to get them from that.  I just snag a 32, a 16, 
and an 8 and get all the wicked eyes I need.  Blackened Bat I think 
could substitute in this place but I'll try both and see if it works 
out okay.

I couldn't help but notice how tedious it is to lay hands on these 
coveted mirror piece items.  So I intend to design a code which will 
give your save file 99 of them, thus reducing the amount of recycling 
needed for some of the more complicated tempering methods.  

Also in the uberrecipies book I noticed that it says you may use any 
seed for the low level dryad boosts but if you continually use spiny 
seeds the yggdrassil card appears rather than dryad.  Is it a mistake 
to use spiny seeds for this requirement?

I've just read the aerolite recipie in the files section and I really 
admire it for its straightforwardness and I'm extremely curious as to 
how this will work on a pair of swifte rock knives.  I'm assuming it 
will get slightly more attack power than the dragon scales version but 
a little less than if I used dior wood.  Of course given the slightly 
higher essenses I could be mistaken.  I'll check back after I'm done 
making them.  

btw, trying to build a code that will alter a single item's quantity 
has not worked out so far.  I think I'm leaving something out somehow.

"Any Seed" almost always means "Non-Spiny Seed".  Spiny Seed is the 
only seed that doesn't produce a Dryad Card, and is one of the hardest 
seeds to get.  We assume you'll use a seed you have plenty of, and use 
Spiny Seeds only where they are called for, as they are extremely 
useful in some parts of tempering (that is, you might as well use 
otherwise-useless items for something, and leave the items that do 
things for, well, WHEN they do things).

yes I thought that might be the assumption.  I just happened to have 
several of them on hand from my attempts to get wicked eyes from 
beholders at lake kilma.  there are some plant enemies in the same 
area.  But I'm actually glad they don't give dryad like I needed 
because the starting over got me back all those good seeds, which I'd 
rather give to trent anyway.

Don't open it with Firefox then. Open it with IE, FireFox needs certain plugins for certain sites. Its a half-decent site in the making. I've maybe decided to continue with it and make it better. The link is http://www.freewebs.com/legendofmanaworld if you forgot.

There seems to be a plugin conflict on your site in Firefox. When I
visit your site it keeps asking me to install Quicktime 6.5.1. The
funny thing is that I have QT 6.5.2 istalled on my machine.

Anything will do; even on the most difficult setting, Legend of Mana=20
is fairly easy, and could probably be beaten easily enough (albeit=20
with a great amount of patience) by someone wielding a 0 Attack Power=20
Flail at Level 1 with -40 to all stats (except for one: let's use HP,=20
since you can counter its HP-Regenerating powers by wearing particular=20
armor... so you have 65 HP Stat, but it does you no good), No HP Regen=20
Armor (AC 0), No Revive Armor (AC 0)...

For a nice spear, I would go with any of the uberrecipes, if you can=20
find the time to hunt the rare items required, or just go with a quick=20
recipe of some sort.

For Armor (and Mantles) there's one text file called, I believe, armor=20
basics, or something like that, which explains the routes you can take=20
for armor.

Just like the title, just need one as soon as possibly possible.  I
don't have the most lucre (12,000), or rarest items, but I have a
couple in short supply.  Just need to make the above items at at least
100+.  Can anyone help?  Btw, I suck at tempering.  Thank you in
advance if you help!!

Have you tried looking in the Files section for a QuickRecipe?  If you=20
have some Dragonscales you can make some quite nice equipment with it,=20
but ordinary equipment should do well, too...

Hello, everyone!

I want to remind you all that spamming is expressly forbidden, and I=20
will ban any members who do so, spambot or not.

Also, in the future, please DO NOT REPLY to these spam messages.

I just accidentally banned the person whose name begins with an "x"=20
(sorry about that, I've removed the ban already) because I thought=20
it was a second identical spam message, since it had an extremely=20
similar Subject line and message text, before I realized it was=20
actually someone who felt the same way I do about these things ;)

I would love to make this group have moderated messages, but sadly I=20
don't have the time to check this group constantly for new messages,=20
and I want people to be able to post their questions and get quick=20
responses even if I am not online.

In the past, I had the group open to posts from anyone, but it=20
eventually was abused to the point where I had to make posting=20
members-only.  I don't want to go further than that - I hope for=20
this group to be open to everyone, but I also want it used for what=20
it was intended for!

The downside to keeping it unmoderated is that there are,=20
inevitably, going to be spambots or spammers.  All you need to do in=20
these cases is contact me (either online through Yahoo, or on AIM as=20
Myst Erik Ery) and I'll deal with the messages, if I haven't noticed=20
already :)

Here's hoping we can keep the group in good order!

(Also, a minor note: If anyone is afraid of getting nasty spam=20
messages in their email, simply change your contact settings to "No=20
Email" or "Announcements Only" , and check the new posts via the=20
group web site)

Sincerely,
JC "Myst Erik Ery" D

Angel Feathers are dropped by Teedies and Garuda.  They are Rank 5=20
items, so you need them to be Level 16 before they'll drop them,=20
unless you're using a Polterbox.

You also earn one if you score 71 to 80 Zerobees at the Shadow Zero=20
Minigame.

www.gamefaqs.com is your friend for anything LoM that doesen't require
extreme numbercrunching and game mechanics analyzis. Well actually it
probably have some TXTs for that too, but this place is better off in
the item creation/customization area.

No

...

The reason its there is as a spacer.
A spacer that isn't needed since the moon crystal prevents the ancient=20
moon card from appearing.

Ack, I think I hurt my brain.
Hows everyone doing?

It might need that mercury in order to get Aura's resistances low
enough to raise twice by draining Dryad, but if one Mercury suffices
then there's no worries.  I think one Mercury probably works just fine.

Thus, it isn't necessary.

I think that was biqut's point?

Sincerely,
JC "Myst Erik Ery" D

My point was that you normally need 4 carded items between world cards.
But here you don't since the cardless moon crystal already got rid of=20
the ancient moon.

Yes, which is why it's unnecessary...  that's what he was asking.

So if it's unnecessary, he's right.  Which is as I suspected.  The way
you said it, though, seemed to imply he was asking a silly/stupid
question.  I don't think he was.  ^_^  At least, I think that's how it
was taken, given his reaction.

Of course, I could be completely off on all of this.

As the subject states, I need a strong spear that contains the=20
elements at least of wind, water and wood.

Anybody got a good idea for something like this?

If any, please let me know. T.Y. :)

If you're looking for an UberRecipe, there's always the DiorWood
UberRecipe.  Alternately, for something amusing, check out the
AltenaFelt Spear Recipe.  It's 999 Attack power, and made out of felt.

No, I really did hurt my brain trying to figure out how AsianGrinch=20
could have made a mistake in one of his recipes.
The effect of cardless items on hidden world cards is pretty subtle=20
stuff.

It's not necessarily a mistake.  It still works, it just uses one more
item than necessary.  ^_^

Perhaps it was a copy edit at some point, never noticed because it
still worked?

Subject: Problems with the AltenaFelt Recipe.

I'm looking it over, and I've come across a few major problems.

#1.

 In Step D, nothing is accomplished...

	Aura Silver
	Mercury
	Fishy Fruit
	Mirror Piece
	Fire Stone
	4x Glow Crystal
	3x Sulpher
	Sala Gold
	Mush-in-a-Box

Draining Sala with the Fishy Fruit is a good idea, but with only one
Wizard Card, Aura's Resistance of 9 is only down to 6, meaning it
requires 2^9 * 6 energy to get to Level 10 ( 3072 ), whereas draining
Salamander from 9->8 releases 2^8 * 10 energy ( 2560 )... so the
energy goes back into Salamander (as its Taint is dealt with before
Undine can become a problem) and then Undine raises to 1...  Then you
use a Mirror Piece (ouch!) and a Firestone to drain Undine back to
0... and then uselessly pop in 4 Glow Crystals + 3 Sulphur + Sala Gold
to "get Sala back to 9" (when really it already got itself back to 9),
and then raise Shade once with the Mush-in-a-Box.

#2. Step G to E.

 Immediately following most "Repeat Step G" (and in fact the initial
Step G) is "Repeat Step E" ... let's take a look.

Step G:
	Corn Flower
	Mercury
	2x Aura Silver
	Fishy Fruit
	Chaos Crystal
	Lilapod
	Mush-in-a-Box
Step E:=20
	Mirror Piece
	2x Sulpher
	Fire Stone
	Honey Onion
	Mercury
	Garlic Crown

So let's look at the last little bit of Step G.

(Spring)Aura/Aura/Witch  +Chaos Crystal
(Ancient Moon)Spring/Aura/Aura   +Lilipods
(Enticed Nymph)Ancient Moon/Spring/Aura  + Mush-in-a-Box
(Enticed Nymph)Ancient Moon/Spring/Aura  + Mirror Piece
(---)Enticed Nymph/Ancient Moon/Spring  !!!!

You see, a Mirror piece is being used for naught!  And thus, you're
not getting the effects of the Mirrored World Card, either...

#3.  Many of those element counters seem to be off... and the end of
Step G, you should have 2 Shade if everything is working the way you'd
really want them to (and in fact you WANT to end with 2 Shade, as far
as I can tell), but it says you'd only have 1 Shade.

:( I don't even want to try to find more errors...

What's up with that?  How have these things gone unnoticed for so
long?  o_O  I could've sworn I've made a cloth spear, too, but maybe I
never actually bothered.  Others have made them, yes?  If so, what's
up, here? O_o=20

You had started the Event already?

Make sure you've talked to Kristie and Sotherbee, and aren't in the
middle of another Event (ie The Blessed Elixir, Catchin' Lilipeas or
Huntin' Du'Cate)...

Make sure you go with no NPC in your party, too, of course...

Tell me more - what Events have you got currently active, and completed?

Has anyone calculated the best weapon type/level combo to maximize=20
character stats?  The best I can come up with is 2 Hammer, 9 Staff, and=20
87 Sword levels which will bring the character to level 99 (the=20
character starts at level 1).  This combo results in 99 Power, 99=20
Skills, 99 Defense, 84 Magic, 76 HP, 78 Spirit, and 84 Charm for a=20
grand total of 619 Stat Pts (not including Luck which is static).

A straight Sword level up scheme for 98 levels (the character starts at=20
level 1) results in 99 Power, 99 Skills, 99 Defense, 78 Magic, 78 HP,=20
78 Spirit, and 84 Charm for a grand total of 609 Stat Pts.

The first method sacrifices -2 HP Stat Pts in exchange for +6 Magic and=20
+6 Charm Stat Pts, which is a better deal overall.

Is there another combo I'm missing which improves the numbers better=20
than my first method?

Set 1: highest total sum of stats

Theorical (with floating values for levels and stats below 99) solution:

93 HP_ (88 + 5)
78 SPT (73.5 + 5)
83 CHM (78.25 + 5)

TOTAL: 589

I couldn't find a solution with 590 total (that doesn't mean it doesn't exi=
st). I'm disappointed I couldn't drain more PWR to shove it somewhere else,=
 but it may be impossible (I'm counting on you guys to tell me if it's impo=
ssible) ; and the one point lost to truncation in the in the other stats bo=
thers me as well

Set 2: highest possible sum of power/skills (prioritizing in order after th=
at: defense, then magic, then sum of spirit/charm)
It's not simple to setup that in a single simplex... Let's see

Theorical highest value of the sum: dunno, the tool forfeited after not bei=
ng able to provide a solution ofter 50 steps... :/
My guess, from some tests I done, is that the higher value is 197 (99 + 98)=
, as displayed in the above example, and there is very little rooms for imp=
rovements.

I admit my failure to provide a definitive answer here. I'll try again once=
 I'll have found more powerful tools.

P.S. : by tweaking the results a bit (it seems the tool is somewhat... sens=
ible to the fact that some variables are ignored), I obtained the same resu=
lt as the above theorical solution: maximum value for PWR + SKL =3D 197.5, =
197 rounding down. And the best solution I found is the same as the one dis=
played... It may be a bug.

I tried going as far as a difference of 3 levels (for each weapon) from the=
 theorical solution, and found nothing better... yet.


Set 3: highest possible sum of power/skills/defense (prioritizing in order =
after that: magic, then sum of spirit/charm)

Same problem here.

P.S. : idem

Set 4: highest possible sum of power/skills/defense/magic (as you can guess=
, sum of spirit/charm after that)

Let's see... *crosses fingers*
Same problem.

P.S. : Same method, ...

Best (theorical) value: 276
Theorical solution:

Optimum HP is 93. At 93 HP, you regain the maximum of 30 HP per second. Com=
pare that to the next lowest range of 89-92, where you only regain 15 HP pe=
r second. As you go further down, it gets even more pathetic: 85-88 is 10 H=
P per second, 81-84 is 7.5 HP per second, 77-80 is 6 HP per second...

No results for HP>93, all other stats >79 (already said).
No result either for HP>89, all other stats >79.
BUT:
HP>85, all other stats >79

Best average (theoretical) solution:

Objet : [LoM Kitchen] Max Character Stats

   Has anyone calculated the best weapon type/level combo to maximize=20
 character stats?  The best I can come up with is 2 Hammer, 9 Staff, and=20
 87 Sword levels which will bring the character to level 99 (the=20
 character starts at level 1).  This combo results in 99 Power, 99=20
 Skills, 99 Defense, 84 Magic, 76 HP, 78 Spirit, and 84 Charm for a=20
 grand total of 619 Stat Pts (not including Luck which is static).
=20
 A straight Sword level up scheme for 98 levels (the character starts at=20
 level 1) results in 99 Power, 99 Skills, 99 Defense, 78 Magic, 78 HP,=20
 78 Spirit, and 84 Charm for a grand total of 609 Stat Pts.
=20
 The first method sacrifices -2 HP Stat Pts in exchange for +6 Magic and=20
 +6 Charm Stat Pts, which is a better deal overall.
=20
 Is there another combo I'm missing which improves the numbers better=20
 than my first method?

Adamanatite is worse than DiorWood and DragonScales for high-essence=20
tempering because of that first number.  That number determines how=20
much essence levels raise the attack value, and a higher number=20
means that each essence level has LESS effect.  With the same number=20
of essence levels, DiorWood would have twice the multiplier from=20
essence levels compared to Adamantite.

Its rediculously easy to make money in this game, as soon as you get
the blacksmith, that is.  In Luon Highway, kill the floaty-squid
things for the hat they drop, then kill the wasp-monsters for the
clear feathers.  Dump four clear feathers into the hat and sell it in
town.  The hat goes for 26k+ every time.  Also, DragonBone pendants
with 2 Blackened Bats, enough to get a wings of darkness card.  Those
sell for like, 20k if not more too.

You'd think there'd be a way to get everything to 99 without using a

OK, so here's a challenge that I'm working on (and failing miserably=20
at too).  I want to make a 2h sword with an attack power of at least=20
400 (wanted to shoot for 666, but that might be impossible), with a=20
shade essence of 6+ and any other "evil" types of things I can add.=20=20
Oh yeah, and I want it to have absolutely NO "good" types of essences=20
or cards at the end.  Thoughts?

OK, that works then.  Murasame it is...the "other" blade from the FF=20
series that ended up with a deserving name...

Although I should name my character Muramasa then shouldn't I?

Huh. Probably need to play 'No Future' mode to get it, then.

What a strange name for sqauresoft to use for a sword! Especially

The only reason I went with 2h is because I could get its stats=20
higher.  If you can give me some pointers on how to raise its stats=20
and also gain these types of attacks, I'm all for changing it to 1h.=20=20
And you are correct, that would be VERY fitting!

Hello!  My weapon of choice is the staff, and I was hoping to be able=20
to recieve two recipes:

First, a recipe that I can do quickly in my first game to gain a=20
solid, strong staff that will easily suit my needs until I could forge=20
an ultimate weapon.

As for the second recipe...the ultimate staff itself!

I tried looking through existing recipes, but not only don't I really=20
understand it, but from what I could see there weren't all that many=20
staff recipes.

Thank you!

You've only added 1 Pine O'Clock so far and nothing else right?  Then,
add in another Pine O'Clock for the Ragnarok card to appear.

It usually takes two of the same item for a card to appear.

Well, to make things short, I'll copy the message I left on GameFAQs.

It's been some time that I've got Legend Of Mana, and the=20
forging/tempering system has got my attention every since.

As a huge fan of 2H Swords, I'd like to know some things...

1st, The best material for a 2H Sword.

2nd, A good recipe...No need of lots of high essences, I just wanted=20
a 2H with a freaking huge Atk power...

3rd, Some good plunge attacks...

Now, I've tested some materials, and I am currently using=20
SwifteRock, as it showed good results (at least to me, a raw 2h=20
Sword yielded 94 atk power), and also making some recipes, but I=20
need to get more materials, so I'd like something like a list so to=20
don't waste time/money/materials...

I've managed to get Ragnarok on a previous test, but is it=20
compatible with Fallen Angel? I never used it.

Is that DiorWood recipe (the one with the 999 2H Axe)worth using?=20
Will it have the same results on a 2H Sword? Please note that I am=20
somewhat new to tempering, but the FAQs here helped me very much.

I am still making/tetsing recipes, and will check this group=20
periodically. Thanks in advance.

I made a lengthy reply on GameFAQs... I'd copy it here, but then I=20
would have to redo all the italics and bolding :P

But basically:
Materials: 3) SwifteRock, 2) DragonScales, or 1) DiorWood
Recipes: Look under "Files" at the left side of the screen
Plunges: There's only 2 for the 2HSword, and you can get them both on=20
the same weapon.

Nope, you're limited to the small number of Mirror Piece chests in=20
each playthrough.  This is why recipes that reduce the number of=20
Mirror Pieces used are quite nice.

Wrong.  Muramasa and Murasame are *NOT* the same thing.  Many people
*CONFUSE* them, hence why it says that Muramasa is sometimes
incorrectly called Murasame.  But that doesn't make them the same -
see, Japanese companies tend not to confuse the two.

Not Masamune's apprentice.  There's a good couple of centuries between
Masamune and Muramasa's time.  And Muramasa's infamy is more linked to
the Tokugawa Shogunate banning the use of Muramasa blades, due to
numerous accidents and incidents that Tokugawa Ieyasu and his
relatives experienced regarding them.

And yes, this is what Murasame always refers to.  The Hakkenden is a
particularly famous and *LONG* novel, and the Murasame itself has a
role that is very similar to Arthurian Legend's Sword in the Stone - a
blade that was said to only be usable by the true rule of the Kantoo
region.

So.  Masamune and Muramasa?  Real life historical blades that have no
real life relation to each other (the comparisons sprang up during
fiction and plays written during the Tokugawa era, since Masamune was
still hailed as the best, and Muramasa was hated by the shogunate).=20
Murasame?  Fictional blade, no known swordsmith of that name.  And
uniquely, a single named blade, rather than just a shorthand meaning
"A sword by <swordsmith>"

didn't bookmark it OR get all the card images (missed number 7, which

Has anyone collected a complete list of uber recipes for all the=20
weapons and equipment? Or shall I just assume that applying the Dragon=20
Scales Uber recipe to everything is the best I'm going to get?

Yes; simply use the DragonScales uberrecipe for any Dragonscales=20
weapons.  All weapons temper the same up until the very, very end.=20=20
That's when you use what's called a "varnish" which *IS* weapon-
specific (and often material-specific, too).

Check varnish.txt to see what varnish is best for YOUR weapon/material=20
combination.  :)

For example, making a DragonScales staff would have you end with 3=20
Holy Water, (one card-creating item to push in the Cleric Card) and a=20
Giant's Horn.

I tried the aerolite recipe and used the SweetRevenge, and followed it
exactly, but ended up with only 836 offense! Its essences are just
like the recipe says, 15 15 15 15 13 14 15 14, with +9s for all stats
and 3 clown mystic powers. I followed the varnish exactly and added
the plunge right in the beginning just like it said. What could have
gone wrong?

There is a bit of a mistake in it I found. I can't remember where
exactly but I believe it was somewhere around tempering in the second
essence. I had to temper in additional firestones because the essence
level was not as it was suppose to be in the recipe. That might have
threw you off. In the end I managed to get the 999 power ax.

Varnish.  With a 2h Axe, Ash for Volcano cards + Scissors is the best=20
varnish for 999.

However you can go Clown, Volcano, Volcano + Scissors and it'll still=20
hit 999 attackpower and you get to keep the +9stats.

The mistake in the aerolite recipe that I noticed way back when but=20
could never fix it was at the very beginning when you initially level=20
up Sala.  Basically getting all the enegy that was put into the gnome=20
for the plunge attack "assisted" sala gains.  So if you tried the=20
recipe on any other type of weapon I think it woulda came up one sala=20
shot with an improper card order when you got around to raising the=20
2nd essence.  I could never fix it though cause SOMEONE decided to put=20
in "editor notes" and yahoo made them think they wrote it :P  (hey=20
Myst :)

A "card item" is any item that will produce a card when tempered into=20
equipment; the card doesn't show up until another card item is=20
tempered in.

Spiny Seeds are a rare drop of Lullabuds, Shrieknips, and Malboros.=20
You will want to be using a Polterbox while item hunting (if you kill=20
something while you are standing next to a pet polterbox, you will=20
have a much better chance of getting rare items).

Chances of getting Spiny Seeds from the above monsters:
(Note: 'Level' is monster's level)
With polterbox:
Levels 1-15 =3D 12.5% (16/128, or 1 in 8)
Levels 16+ =3D 6.25% (8/128, or 1 in 16)
Without polterbox:
Levels 1-31: 0.0%
Levels 32-47: 3.125% (4/128, or 1 in 32)
Levels 48+: 1.5625% (2/128, or 1 in 64)

Hi, I've heard that the Pocketstation game system was only released in=20
Japan, but I saw something that has lead me to believe that there may=20
be an English version of LOM for the Pocketstation.  If anyone has=20
info on this subject, please let me know.

Subject: Hero stats + Equip stats

Almost forgot, I was also wondering about how the numbers for the=20
stats (strength, spirit, luck, etc.)are added and how the limits are=20
set.  For example, all of your hero's stats (excluding luck) are=20
limited to a max of 99, but you can't get them all to 99 without=20
cheating.  So, you'll be using added stat bonuses from equipment.=20=20
Now, here's the part that I don't know- If the sum of the numbers for=20
the same stat is over the limit (98 for hero and 20 on a weapon or=20
something), does the game cap the sum off at 99, or can you have=20

From Wikipedia:

"The PocketStation is a miniature game console created by Sony as a=20
peripheral for the PlayStation. Released exclusively in Japan on=20
December 23, 1998 [...]"

"Although the system was not released in North America or Europe,=20
there were apparently plans to do so - a feature on the system=20
appeared in Official UK PlayStation Magazine, for example, and a few=20
games (such as Final Fantasy VIII) retained PocketStation=20
functionality in their localised versions. As a result, the PC version=20
of Final Fantasy VIII added a stand-alone Chocobo World game as part=20
of the installation."

Sorry, but unless you are using the Japanese or PC versions of the=20
games (and consoles), I'm pretty sure you can't use a Pocketstation.

Honestly, I don't know. I don't think many of the other users come=20
here anymore, either; the site has pretty much been hijacked by=20

Did LoM even have a Pocketstation minigame to go with it?  I don't
remember at this point.  Even if it did, I'd bet it wasn't coded into

You can have higher than 99 with bonuses from equipment; some stats=20
have a prime point; for example, the HP Stat gives you the best HP=20
Regeneration at 97 HP Stat (I believe?) , so anything more than that=20
is unnecessary except for resistance to poison and for resistance=20
against certain other attacks and such.

In the files section there is a file called "varnish.txt".

This file contains all the information you'll ever need to know=20
about which varnishes to use for which weapon/material combintion ---
 it's different for each weapon/material, since it affects the=20
material's values, which in turn are affected by the weapon's values=20
to get the final Offense Power.
In addition, this file shows the power of that weapon made of that=20
material with the maximum amount of essences possible on that=20
material (and at 0 essences) so you can compare strengths.

So sorry about that!
I really only frequent here every so often, so if it starts getting=20
bad, you really have to post a message on the GameFAQs board about=20
it: http://boards.gamefaqs.com/gfaqs9/gentopic.php?board=3D256525
I frequent that board, so that would be a great way to get ahold of=20
me if I'm not on your AIM friend list.

One minor note:

Make sure that if you DO make a Reply to the spammers... CHANGE THE=20
SUBJECT LINE!
I don't know how many times I've nearly banned someone by accident=20
because they had the same text in their message and I almost didn't=20
notice that it was simply quoted...
Please don't reply directly to the spammers, thank you! :)

Again, sorry for all that mess :( It's bad of me.


ALSO NOTE: I've fixed the Aerolite recipe, as requested :P You do=20
know you could have just, I dunno, made a second copy?

ALSO NOTE: The Calc program does Aerotites wrong.  Newly-forged=20
Aerolites should come with 4 Salamander Essence.

Thank you all for your patience!

Thanks a bunch for that.  Actually, 2 minutes after I posted that, I
took a closer look at the available files, and I saw "Varnish.txt".

Embarrasing, right?

Well, for the few items that need it, I can make assumptions.  Thanks.

I'd love to make the group moderated, but it's too much work for me=20
to approve everyone, and so on, and moderate the messages.  I want=20
to keep it open.  That way anyone can just run in, join, and snag=20
the recipes they want.

I find it amusing that there were so many cooking spams, though :P=20
That was rather funny, as it was actually trying to be appropriate!

Anyway, though, if it ever gets bad, please, contact me on=20
GameFAQs!  I'm ALWAYS there, really, so just pop in and mention it's=20
getting bad :P

I really should clean out the Files Section, though, and organize=20
all of the recipes and make sure they all work by testing them out.=20=20
In fact, I think I'll work on that right now, a little bit...  I=20
dunno.

I'm a bit depressed.  My laptop's screen is smashed:
http://img120.imageshack.us/img120/1152/promyvioncn8.jpg
Heh.

So I might just burst into tears sometime today.  I dunno...  :(

Just been a bit down in general :D  Ah well.

I'm crafting a weapon for a friend of mine...  A 1-H Sword,
specifically...  And I've been wondering which is the better material
to make the weapon out of (after tempering):

Dragon Scales, or Dior Wood?

Well, from what I can see, DiorWood is the clear winner. 1H Swords=20
will never be as powerful as most of the other weapons (post-
tempering), but a DiorWood Sword should be pretty strong if tempered=20
properly. There is a DiorWood recipe in the Files section, BTW (It's=20

Who had that program that let me find out what material/card
combination could make a particular attack power with a particular
total essences?  Because it would really help me out.  :)

I know very little about Tempering, but as I check my e-mail more regularly than most, allow me to welcome you to the Kitchen.

As for essence totals, I have seen items with 15 in some elements, though I believe it is impossible in practice to obtain 15 in all of them at once. The reason some guides state that it is impossible to get over 10 is most likely that they are simply old guides, developed before Tempering was fully understood.

Keep in mind, I might be wrong. Anyone, feel free to correct me on this!

I have found that I got a weapon up to 12 in several essences
personally using lots of coins, chaos crystals, and glow crystals, so
I know you can get at least that high. though I have never gotten
enough money and mirror shards to go any higher.  I would believe that
the essences can get to 14 or 15 though i have never gotten there.  If
anyone would explain how to use mirror shards properly in a short
description, I'm sure there are a few who would appreciate it.  all i
can ever find is that it reverses the consumptions, but how that could
best be used is beyond me.

I'm not a genius in tempering by any means but from what I understand=20
mirror pieces are used to get the card mirror world. Mirror world=20
reverses domininance. IIRC the top row of elements have dominance over=20
the lower row which allows the top row to consume energy already in=20
the bottom row to level up past level 10. Mirror world would allow the=20
bottom row to consume energy from the opposing top row element.

Hopefully I can clear some of this up.

Mirrored World does indeed reverse dominance.  However, the
"upper-row" essences do not dominate the "lower-row" ones.

Under normal conditions:
Wisp can always rise.
Shade cannot rise if Wisp is present.
Dryad cannot rise if Aura is present and [Shade>Wisp] is true.
Aura cannot rise if Dryad is present and [Wisp>Shade] is true.
Salamander cannot rise if Undine is present.
Gnome cannot rise if Salamander is present.
Jinn cannot rise if Gnome is present.
Undine cannot rise if Jinn is present.

You'll notice there's two sets here.  The "lower-row" essences
(Salamander, Gnome, Jinn, Undine) are simply cyclic.  This is why you
can always raise two of them without conflict provided the other two
are at zero (Salamander and Jinn, or Gnome and Undine) because they do
not interfere with each other.

The "upper-row" essences are a bit stranger.  Wisp and Shade are a
dual, but Wisp is always able to rise, whereas it is better to begin
by raising Shade as it cannot rise once you begin to raise Wisp.
Dryad and Aura depend on Wisp and Shade.
Dryad, the being of life and thus associated with light, requires Wisp
dominance.
Aura, the being of metal and thus associated with darkness, requires
Shade dominance.

Mirrored World simply reverses these effects.
The "lower-row" is backwards: Undine cannot rise if Salamander is
present, and so on.
The "upper-row" is backwards: Wisp cannot rise if Shade is present
(but Shade can always rise)... and Dryad now depends on Shade
dominance, whereas Aura depends on Wisp dominance.

The reason high-level tempering uses Mirrored World is to "slosh" energy.

When draining (which has ever-so-slightly different rules than simply
being able to raise an essence, but which is also reversed with
Mirrored World) , you can often raise two essences at once at the cost
of only one essence point.

Effectively, you'll be "sloshing" energy back and forth between Aura
and Dryad.
Let's say you have 0 Wisp, 15 Shade, 14 Aura, 15 Dryad, 14 Salamander,
and 14 Jinn.
You can see that this is ready to "slosh".

When you drain Dryad (using Aura, which you can do, since Shade>Wisp)
and provide a Jinn TP (and have enough Wizard cards present: both Jinn
and Aura use Witch, which is why we're raising Jinn and not Salamander)...
Aura -> 15
Dryad -> 14
Jinn -> 15

So now we have 0/15/15/14/14/0/15/0.

Now, making sure we don't just drain Dryad down to 0 (which is why we
use things like Garlicrowns, which only provide an Aura taint point
once, thus preventing residual drains), we want to raise Salamander.
How?
Well, now we utilize Mirrored World.
If we can drain while under the effects of Mirrored World, we can have
Dryad drain Aura (instead of vice-versa) with Shade>Wisp.

Thus, since Dryad and Salamander are both being raised, we can get
away with using Sorcerer.

So really, Mirrored World doesn't help with raising limits in and of
itself - it just allows you to "slosh" energy back and forth, allowing
spillover energy to raise the lower-row essences.

Gloomoths drop Moth Wings, of course.

http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/psx/file/256525/30684

It's their Rank 5 drop, so it's best to fight them between Level 16
and 31, using a Polterbox.

There are two ways you can get Ishe Platinum.  You can receive it for=20
accomplishing missions later in the game after you have exhausted=20
artifacts, and you can also buy it from a shop if you place the city=20

Hello,

OK this will sound ridiculous, this is the simplest of questions...=20
The ultimate newbie question.

I have the springball pet and I leveled him up to 25.  Then i went
back home, filled his box with food and left him in the barn to eat.

I walk around the world map to make days pass by.  When i returned to
my house and checked on my pet, the box was still full.....

So i ventured out again, walk around the world multiple times, and
always returned to find the box full.

Can anyone please let me know what I've done wrong?  I've pretty much
done everything else in the game, but I've never touched the pet
section before...:s i saved it for last...

So my question is, what are the exact procedures for feeding your pet?

Level it up once.

Pets eat only when they gain a level, and they eat everything in their
food box.

Thus, you only have 98 opportunities to feed your pet, and that's only
if you can remember to get back to the corral to add more feed before
you level it up a second time by mistake.

I'm not really sure how Yahoo groups work, so forgive me if this info=20
is available elsewhere already (and link too).

Basically, recipes for "ultimate" weapons (1 of each class, with a=20
good assortment of plunge attacks on as many of the 3 slots as=20
possible), and armor (to get all defenses to 99 or as close as=20
possible, plus all status protections, and keeping HP regen if=20
possible). Powers such as quick revive and other special effects are=20
also priority if possible. +20s too, of course.

For the life of me I can't wrap my head around the tempering system's=20
nuances, so I figured I'd ask here for help.

Oh, one last thing. I'd like the weapons to be of varying "ultimate"=20
materials, and powers reflective of their type (for example, while 2H=20
axe and sword may get to like 950, 1H axe and sword are like 750,=20
knives around 600, and so on). Inkwo at least that different materials=20
work better/different with different weapon classes, so yeah.

Thanks in advance, and sorry for my n00bishness.

>=20

Is there a list somewhere that delineates all that each stat does? Or,
for that matter, any more of the LoM's formuale? Frankly, I'm still
not sure what the Power and Tech stats really determine.

Yes.  A Ring or Pendant with the Fertility Goddess effect will cause
all experience you pick up to be shared.  Alternately, you can use the
ForbiddenRing earned by completing "The Wisdom of Gaeus".

Also, if you have your pet grazing in the corral, it will receive free
experience proportional to the experience you gain while it's grazing.

How can we forge a piece of Equipment to have the Fertility Goddess=20
effect? and does the material/equip type matter and can it be canceled?

Only Rings and Pendants can have the Fertility Goddess effect.  Simply
add the Fertility Goddess Mystic Card (which requires 5 Dryad essence,
and the Ear of Wheat item, plus something to push the Fertility
Goddess onto the piece of equipment).  Just don't add any other
effects after, and it'll be the Effect of your equipment (for example,
adding the "No HP Regen" Effect of Bed of Thorn will overwrite the
"Share Exp" effect of the Fertility Goddess).

Just wear the ring or pendant, and voila!

If you want the effect to end, just take off the ring or pendant.  You
can remove it from the ring or pendant only by replacing it with
another Effect, but that's not too hard, either, if you really wanted
to do so.

Im new here and wanted to ask a question....

in the varnishing guide it says underneath staff and diorwood: 2222

I look up 2 and that says....
2 is Cleric card, Giants Horn item

I dont know what it means, for example...

Does that mean a cleric card (Is it holy water that does that?)
and the a giant's horn 4 times? Even though I've seen 3 cleric cards
then a giant's horn in numerous guides as the basic varnish process?
Or is that just saying that 222 is the cleric cards (as the items you
put on) and the last 2 is the giant's horn?

also under staff is: 2226 (a different materal that I can think of at
the moment)

6 is Dragon's Breath

does that mean that I do three cleric cards and then finish it with a
dragon's breath?

Thanks! (Although I cant afford to do ANY of the uber recipies its
good to know XD)

Being on PSP won't change how you learn STs.

Each ST has a required value for Weaponskill and Abilityskills.

Every battle you are in, you get one Weaponskill point for the weapon
you have equipped, and one Abilityskill point for each ability you
have set.  You don't have to actually use the abilities, just have
them equipped for that battle.

Once you go past the threshold to learn a new ability or ST, you'll do
so.  So, just equip the right weapon, and use the required abilities
(switching them around if the ST requires multiple abilities, until
you learn it).

The first three numbers means the Mystic Cards, and the final number
is the "capper" item.

2222 means you want to end with three Cleric Cards on your equipment,
and cap it with a Giant's Horn.
You could go 4 Holy Water + Giant's Horn , to make sure you have the
three Cleric Cards (if you only use three Holy Water, you will
probably end up with only 2 Cleric Cards, as one will be in the
invisible slot --- Giant's Horn doesn't add a Mystic Card unless you
have certain essences).

I think I understand what you mean. But is there a way I connect=20
something to the PSP to give the PSP the L2 and R2 button, that you=20
would have on a playstation controller ?

I think that depends on how you're emulating the game.  It might not
be possible, but I don't know about it.  On the plus side, you never
*need* those buttons, so that, at least, is fortunate.

Evarastral, I had a real problem with earning cash in the game at
first (at best in a game you only get 10-20 grand and thats searching)
 But I saw on a guide way back when that you can combine a wind cap
with 4 bug wings( I think thats what they are called) and you get
22000 lucre,  It's the only way i was able to afford all the glow and
chaos crystals necessary for the better equipment.  All that stuff can
be gotten at luon highway (though the bug wings can take a little
while)  Hope that helps you get some of those weapons you have been eying!

No store-bought way of making a lot of money (that would be too easy!).

WindCap are dropped by Spiny Cones quite often, whereas Clear Feathers
are dropped by Stinger Bees.  Both are found on the Luon Highway.

If you temper four Clear Feathers into a WindCap, it will sell for
26667 Lucre.  That should be plenty! :)

There are five ranks of monster for each classification (check your
Monster Encyclopedia, they're listed in order!), except for
Poltergeist (it only has four) and Demi-Human (as they don't come from
eggs.

The higher the rank, the harder it is to get that monster's egg unless
you place the land you find them in far from Home.  So you're going to
have an extremely difficult time finding one at Luon Highway if you
placed it near Home, but an easier time at Lake Kilma if you place it
further away.

You won't be able to tell what rank of monster it is from any given
egg, though you can sometimes tell what monster is inside by looking
at your egg's Offense and HP scores (which it tells you before it
hatches).

These values are the same as the level 1 monster's stats.  Thus, if
you catch plenty of Aerial Eggs, you can figure out which one is a
chocobo by looking at your Aerial Eggs (either go to sell a pet
monster when you find too many eggs, or check back at your corral) and
seeing if any have the stats of a level 1 chocobo (or, instead, just
sell the ones that have duplicate stats as an Aerial Monster you
already have that isn't a chocobo).

I never knew there were ranks. I was very upset that when I beat the
game instead of continuing to the whole game restart it wouldn't get
through the scenes after killing the mana goddess. I was sooooo mad.=20

Gato Grottos will allow you to collect coins faster than any other
place; in the egg/spirit room there, the spirits are slightly closer
than normal. This allows you to skip the music-playing minigame and
simply run quickly to the closer spirit, grabbing coins from it before
it can vanish on you.

If you need specific coins, raise the element levels you need in the
Grottos to make those spirits show up more often; otherwise, try
maxing out all of its elemental properties by placing the Tree of Mana
next to it, for a good chance of any spirit appearing there.

This is also possible (and easier to do) at Mekiv Caverns.

Hey,
I began playing LoM again after several years of absence. Does anyone
remember the primary locations of the Mirror Piece pouch? Also, if
anyone has the tempering recipe for the dubbed "Uber Pendant" which
gives immunity to all statuses and a +20 to all stats, that would be
greatly appreciated as well.

I don't know anything about the Mirror Pieces, but the Uber Pendant if=20
found in the LoM Kitchen:

Files -> Recipe Book -> RECIPE 2

Vilurum on the LoM GameFAQS message board also suggested:

Files -> AdamPendant for metals

after killing the mana goddess you can continue playing, since that is the
only way to get enough mirror pieces for the big recipes. I am unsure how
it works on the psp (I assume thats what you're playing on) but in the PS1
version you were given the option to save after beating her, loading that
save started the game over with levels, pets, and items carried over.

Off the top of my head I know the following mirror piece locations:
- In Elle's cage at Madora Beach
- On the first level of the Jewel City in a jewel room (I forget which one =
but it was blue)
- In the Mana Tree's sanctuary, I think in the middle room of the northeast=
 side

Not sure if there are more than that but I remembered those.

A plunge attack are those attacks you do when you do a thrust=20
forward/attack, a jump forward/attack, and then when you swing your=20
blade up in an uppercut manner/attack. I cant remember exactly how to=20
execute them, but i do know that prior to press SQUARE, your movement=20
is what determines the plunge attack you use.. if you move backwards=20
then forward quickly then press SQUARE, then you will execute the=20
jumping plunge attack, that is the only 1 i can remember how to do off=20
the top of my head.

Plunge attacks are the attacks you do when you tap certain directional
buttons before hitting the strong attack button. There's three, as far
as I recall. Tappping twice in a direction gets you a lunging attack
on most weapons, tapping left-right or right-left gets you a leaping
attack, and doing what I always thought of as the fireball motion
(roll from down to either left or right) gets you an upward swing that
knocks enemies back.

When it comes to the crafting stuff though, you can replace the plunge
attacks with special ones.  The attack animation is the same, but
they'll have various special effects.  I didn't even knew they existed
though, these special ones, until long after I stopped playing. :)

You're very close.

Limitations are indeed set by the card with the best limitations - in
this case, the only -10 ~ +20 cards are the Evil God cards, as you
mentioned.

However, the Evil God cards also apply a -1 to all stats as their
"bonus", which means you'll be hard pressed to actually get to +20!

This is why two Yggdrasil cards are usually used: Yggdrasil's bonus is
+1 all, so it can countereffect the Evil God card's detrimental effect
if you have one. Thus, with one Yggdrasil, you're gaining +0 each
tempering step, which still isn't enough to level it up. This is where
you either throw in a second Yggdrasil (making sure it applies *after*
the Evil God's -1, or you get to +15 maximum since that last boost can
never fully apply, as you go from [14] (+15) to [15] (+20) from the
first Yggrasil, and then from to [15] (+20) to [15] (+20) with the
second Yggdrasil, and then from [15] (+20) to [14] (+15) from the Evil
God Card... hence why the order is important!) or you can temper in
items like Dragon's Blood or Toadstoolshed (which have a bonus of +1
all)... though those two might cause you card problems, depending on
material type and current essences (which is why the double-Yggrasil
method is so prominent).


.... and armor.doc is in the Files section, I believe, rei075.
Make sure when you post messages, you put the message ABOVE the reply,
or at least WITHOUT the preceding ">" mark, since otherwise people
think it's part of the original message.

Are you playing on a ROM?  If so, you *theoretically* could play with
two players (because it's the exact same game as the playstation
version, and you can play with two players there)... however, that
would depend on your emulator and how it works.  If the emulator
supports multiple players, you can. Otherwise, you can't.

I don't know.  Like I said, if you're using an Emulator, it depends on
how the Emulator does it.

It'd be easier if you actually explained how you're doing it. I can't
help you without any of that information.

Try looking at your emulator's documentation.

Just one simple question. Is it possible to temper a weapon to have a=20
flameburst, freezing or any other status change effect?

Recently i decided to look up pets, thier locations and such and found=20
that some pets have the awesome synchro-effect to induce stun(Teedie-=20
Beast egg(the 1 w/ 25hp and 9att if i remember correctly) located in=20
lake Kilma- "eastern shore"), and then the 3 to induce flameburst=20
(tomato man(demi human), found in ulkan mines if you have the place at=20
salamadner lvl 4).. i thought it'd be great if you can get those=20
effects w/o a pet's sycho-effect.

I noticed in another post recently it was said that there is no=20
store-bought method to make money.  I had never really thought about=20
looking for one before, but now I was curious...

I fumbled around with some recipes and whatnot, and I came up with=20
something.
Make a weapon using this recipe...

ToppleCotton: 60 Lucre, Item Shop Rank 1
Earthstone: 250 Lucre, Item Shop Rank 1
Waterstone: 250 Lucre, Item Shop Rank 1
Any Seed x3: 10 Lucre in Bone Fortress, if you really want to buy=20
some
Aroma Oil x4: 250 Lucre apiece, Item Shop Rank 3

Total cost is 1,590.  It will sell for just over 12,000, depending=20
on item type.  (I had just made a knife.)

This recipe isn't really a big deal, it doesn't make as much as the=20
standard Windcap or Pine O'Clock trick, but the nifty thing is that=20
all of these materials can be bought at a store somewhere.

I searched and searched but i didnt find that i have been looking=20
for. But seeing how there are some real LoM buffs who give thier two-
cents here, i think this woul dbe the l=3Dplace to ask.

So.. as you may see from my last post, i got very into Pets. I have=20
my Polterbox for it's Rare Drop synchro, Teedie for Stunning synchro,=20
Spring Ball for Invinsible syncho, Tomato Man for Flameburst syncho
(my personal favorite), and last and not least my Land Dragon who i=20
have just because he's a real bad-ass.
I've been leveling 3 of those pets and found that the stats from the=20
fruit i give them doesnt always project onto the pet after it's=20
eaten, like i've fed 1 THREE Toadstoolsheds (raises ALL strength=20
stats by 1 point each) but the stats moved up only 1 or 2. Same goes=20
when i feed my pet 3 different fruits for raise Luck.
Is there more than meets the eye when it comes to fruits? Does which=20
fruit being in a specific slot have different or primary effects over=20
the others?
And this subject here isnt important, but i still wonder.. does each=20
trait and it's pros and cons? I've noticed my pet follows me when i=20
feed it a lot of fruit to up the "friendly" stat, but when i "Pet=20
it", it doesnt say so.. and when the trait is Aggressive, the monster=20
tends to attack more. Other than "lazy"(which i can naturally=20
assume..), and the other traits i've just mentioned, do they make any=20
difference in game-play?

Try these two FAQs; they explain everything -- both in regard to fruit *and* the various pets:<br><br>Pet Raising Guide by HonestLiar<br>http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/psx/file/256525/16412<br><br>Pets and Plants FAQ by KurasuSoratobu<br>http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/psx/file/256525/9432<br><br><br><b><i>r_w_7_2 &lt;no_reply@yahoogroups.com&gt;</i></b> wrote:<blockquote class="replbq" style="border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); margin-left: 5px; padding-left: 5px;">             <div id="ygrp-text">             <div>I searched and searched but i didnt find that i have been looking <br> for.

I only know about one established Chocobo diet, and it was written up
by DragonBlood97:

1 level of 1 Cornflower and 2 Dialaurel
18 levels of 2 Cabbadillo and 1 Dialaurel
18 levels of 1 Cabadillo and 2 Bug Meat
25 levels of 1 Pear o' Heels and 2 Cornflower
36 levels of 2 Cabbadillo and 1 Bug Meat

Level 99
    99    99    99    99              DEF:  76/76/76/54
    99    99    99    05              Total: 282 DEF points

Now, I'm not sure if there are others roaming about or not, but this
is the one I use (I'm abysmal at best at making my own diets >_>).

The only one I know of was created by DragonBlood97 from the message boards on gamefaqs (it can be found on the LoM Wiki, but I'll re-post it for your convenience):

1 level of 1 Cornflower and 2 Dialaurel
18 levels of 2 Cabbadillo and 1 Dialaurel
18 levels of 1 Cabadillo and 2 Bug Meat
25 levels of 1 Pear o' Heels and 2 Cornflower
36 levels of 2 Cabbadillo and 1 Bug Meat

Level 99
    99    99    99    99              DEF:  76/76/76/54
    99    99    99    05              Total: 282 DEF points

I'm not sure if there are any others floating around somewhere, but this is the one I use (because I'm abysmal at best at making my own >_>;).

Looks like you'd feed it those three items that many times, in that order.

Example being 4x Dialaurel, Gold Clover, Rocket Papaya. What this says
is you'd feed it those three items 4 times total. And then you go on
to the next one until reach the end.

This is my guess at least.

I think it means how many levels you feed it each of those sets of
items to give it optimal stats.

The "4x, 30x" etc. refers to that many levels of the listed foods to=20
feed.  Example, for four levels feed your pet the Dialaurel, Gold=20
Clover, Rocket Papaya, then for 30 levels feed him the Gabbadillo,=20
Gold Clover, Rocket Papaya, then for 13 levels...you get the idea.

The "x" stands for how many levels you'll be using those fruits for. If that doesn't make sense, then maybe this will clear it up:

4 levels of Dialaurel, Gold Clover, Rocket Papaya
30 levels of Cabbadillo, Gold Clover, Rocket Papaya
13 levels of Cabadillo, Dialaurel, Gold Clover
51 levels of Cabadillo, Bug Meat, Bug Meat

Boy.

I remember joining this group some years ago when I was all about LoM.
Well, recently I started back up and I remember I had an easy recipe
for a LorimarIron 2H sword that was pretty easy. Check out the site I
made like 4 years ago for Legend of Mana.


www.freewebs.com/legendofmanaworld

It's in the forging section :).
If anyone wants me to start working on the site again I will, of
course if I get enough people saying yes.

Essence, on a weapon, raises attack power. And once it gets to a=20
certain level (2?  I don't know.) it gets that essence's marker,=20
which makes your attacks partly aligned with that essence.  The best=20
way to raise attack power is to first increase a weapon's essence=20
levels.

Essences on armor don't do much (as far as I know) until it gains=20
that essences' marker, which gives you a 10% resistance to attacks=20
of that essence.

Any single essence can usually be raised to 15 using complex forging=20
techniques.  Total, certain essences can hit 15 while others might=20
only get to 14 or 9.  It depends on the material you use.


(This is all off the top of my head, it might be a little off.=20=20
Somebody correct me if i'm off)

Oh, and if you're looking for perfect HP Regen, there's a cap.  I'm=20
not sure of the exact number, but I'm thinking that it's 93, although=20
a quick search showed it could be 97.

What is the different between Normal Mode, Nightmare Mode and No Future=20
Mode (I already know each mode is harder as we go on. For example,=20
nightmare mode is more harder then normal mode, and no future is harder=20

From what I understand, in Nightmare Mode, all enemies are 50 levels stronger; and in No Future Mode, all enemies are at Level 99.

Yes, actually. You do get rarer item drops.

You should probably refer to Myst Erik Ery's Monster Drop FAQ for all the info. on it, though:

Monster Drop Guide found here.
http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/psx/file/256525/30684
It thoroughly explain how monster levels affect item drops.

I believe you can with the right plunge effects on your weapon. Not
all weapons have them available but some of the plunge attacks are
supposed to cause status effects. You should be able to temper a god
of destruction card onto a sword and get the "flametongue" plunge
attack which causes flameburst. Try looking for a good item tempering
effects chart to see which ones you can use.

Here's one chart that I know of:

http://www.geocities.com/xo_pitseleh/lom2.html

Personally, I would put temper a 1H Sword with the Vampsword plunge=20
attack.  You might as well kill your enemy while absorbing its energy=20
(actually works very well on bosses in No Future Mode).

Is there anything special about playing two player?

As in: When you gain exp and levels, is it transfered when you leave?

And what about a "Forbidden Ring" on the 2P?

I would like to experiment, I have no urge to hack a second file for
this purpose, and was wondering if anyone had any previous experience.

There's nothing exactly "special" about it, except that it's fun to play wi=
th friends/family.

You *can* transfer EXP if you want (the game will prompt you to save when t=
he second character leaves), but all Lucre always stays with the first play=
er.

As for that last thing, if the 2P is wearing the ring, then it doesn't do a=
nything. 2Ps don't gain stat benefits from armor. If your 1P is wearing the=
 ring, then yes EXP can be shared between them.

The only thing special about playing 2 players is the second person can bet=
ter control how many xp crystals are picked up by the NPC.=A0 2 player mode=
 isn't done very well in this game.=A0 Not at all like Secret of Mana for s=
nes...=A0 2 player was good in that one. :)

xp gained by the 2nd player stays with the second player, and I don't think=
 forbidden ring can even be equipped on the second player.

Unless you have a friend sitting there bored watching you play the game, or=
 you have already played the game and are getting a friend to play it there=
's no benefit to 2 player mode.

Good Luck,
Ed

p.s. - look at the map placement guide and play through the game following =
one of those setups.=A0 You'll be able to get much better items. :)

So if I import another player (the house in domina), will he keep his
stats from the armor he is already wearing?

And I am already following a guide or two and have a good idea on what
I want ^_-.

Thanks for the replies.

Yup, the imported character keeps their stats... but their stats in no way =
effect your own.

Oh, and if their armor has some extra thing on it (like extra lucra/exp/etc=
..), those won't travel over.

I've already got an "Uber Pendant" so I don't need the status
defenses, elemental defenses, etc.  I'm trying to get 99/99/99/99
defense, WITHOUT sacrificing the ability to regenerate HP (Or at least
come as close as possible).  Can anyone hit me with a guide to some
Armor and maybe a Mantle with high numbers, that still allow you to heal?

It's really all about the cards you pick at the end. The HP regain and
the no HP regain are from the respective cards. It is all about
substituting which cards you would rather have on the armor.

I will help you but to do so I need you to tell me an example of your
problem(materials used both primary and secundary, and order of
tempering, and obiously what you are making for example a sword or a
shield) In order to identify the problem.
Bye.

sulpher
sulpher

I forgot to mention that the glow crystal may not be nessecary to get the e=

if the last sala silver doesn't work then a glow crystal is a good way to g=

Also glow crystals cost 2000 each so it is wasteful to use one if you don't=

sword out of this it is better to start like normal and just do this when y=

boosting salamander.  That way you don't waste materials.=20

I've been following the recipe featured here and something doesn't quite co=
me out right. I've followed the steps to the T multiple times and at the po=
int where I temper the spiny seed in, the sword has all elements but dryad =
at 5, dryad is a 4. Since Yggdrasil needs 5 or more points in dryad I just =
get the Dryad mystic card. I'm confident the problem is not with the recipe=
 itself, but I also know I've done all the steps as listed. I'm not sure wh=
ere the process is going wrong. I don't really understand the inner-working=
s of the tempering system all that well, but I do know that dryad generally=
 wont raise if Shade > Wisp and Aura is present. So Dryad would have to be =
5 before beginning to raise Aura, but that is about the extent of my essenc=
e knowledge on those elements. Can anyone help me understand what the issue=
 might be? One thing I never understood is certain steps in tempering back =
firing... or how to detect it. Thanks in advance.

I'm no where NEAR expert in smithing. Although i have some understanding, i=
 still just follow the recipes that i see;P But one thing i can say that mi=
ght apply to you is that if you used gameshark to get all items, it creates=
 a lot of 'dummy' items that arent really what they say they are and they j=
ust mess up the whole thing.. i've done this w/ weapons that took several h=
ours to make. I'm a noob.

97 is the cap. I have a natural 71 in HP.

With a +25 total bonus to HP, and with Heavens Scale on armor, I noticed I =

I miss my gameshark lol.

So... assuming you can't share experience as P2, the move-regen and auto-re=

For those not using a Gameshark, I figured I'd share the method I use to co=
llect coins and grow fruit. I basically just place the Mana Tree between Ho=
me, Mekiv, and the Orchard. I go to the room in Mekiv that has a Land Drago=
n in it, just keep heading to the right and always take the top path. Once =
two spirits show up, choose to not play music and run towards the closer of=
 the two spirits. You should make it in time to get coins.

Hi, I just joined and have used info from the files section to my advantage=
 very nicely.

But I recently found a site that has a materials list that differs from the=
 one found here.

It can be found here: http://www.reocities.com/xo_pitseleh/lom2.html

It seems that the list are only three years apart (The website was last upd=
ated in 2001, the list here is from 2004.

The name for the page happens to be "Translated Ultimania Tempering Charts.=
"

So can anyone tell me which has more accurate info?

Shade and Wisp have no effect on Dryad. Only Aura does. The best way to get=
 essecences to 5+, is to start with Shade. I've found that Shade doesn't li=

I've recently started playing LoM again, and hadn't ever had a lot of luck =
tempering before I started studying the system. Since the last time I playe=
d LoM was when I was a teenager (1999...seems so long ago.) If anyone has a=
ny suggestions on how to get a sword to that kind of attack, PLEASE let me =
know.=20

Actually, Shade and Wisp have a rather direct effect on Dryad.

As long as Wisp > Shade, then Dryad will drain Aura, and Aura can't rise.
As long as Shade > Wisp, then Aura will drain Dryad, and Dryad can't rise.

In addition, if Wisp is present, then Shade can't rise... and if Wisp > Sha=
de, then Wisp will drain Shade to 0.

Both are right! The translated charts are correct for the Japanese version =
of the game. For some reason, before releasing the game in the US, they cha=
nged many material values. Some of these changes make absolutely no sense (=
stones became very light, so make terrible Hammers, whereas cloth now have =
very high Sharp values instead of good technique, so make terrible gloves b=
ut decent spears) but hey, we've got what we've got.

If you're playing the US version, use the charts you'll find here. :)

Did you by chance use an All-Items Code to give yourself maximum of every i=
tem? There are a great deal of "dummy" items, that do nothing, and they tak=
e the name from another nearby item. If so, you're probably adding a garbag=
e item that has the name "Mercury" or "Sulpher", but isn't actually the rig=
ht item. In this case, you're adding an item with under 32 energy, and this=
 causes Nymph of Dawn to leave the item (since she is pushed out automatica=
lly in such a case) without actually adding the appropriate wizard card.

Hello! My weapon of choice is the staff, and I was hoping to be able
to recieve two recipes:

First, a recipe that I can do quickly in my first game to gain a
solid, strong staff that will easily suit my needs until I could forge
an ultimate weapon.

As for the second recipe...the ultimate staff itself!

I tried looking through existing recipes, but not only don't I really
understand it, but from what I could see there weren't all that many
staff recipes.

Thank you!

Also if you dont prefer staff can you give your weapon of choice and the re=
cipe. thanks

I apologize for all that awful spam. I turn off moderation so people can ac=
tually post (now that Legend of Mana is released on PSN, it should be more =
active here) and of course it gets spammed to death within a week or so.

I will temporarily turn on message moderation until another solution presen=
ts itself.

Hi, I am playing now and have a dragonscales staff that is 934 attk power. =
 I used an existing recipie on this site plus differing plunge/varnish item=
s.  That was literally the only difference.  I'll look around and see if I =
can point you to it.  the point is, what matters for the entire elemental p=
rocess is not weapon type, but material type.  The only part where weapon t=
ype matters is in plunge/varnish parts. Ah, I found it. look in the file se=
ction for 'dragon uber'.  Just use that and then the appropriate varnish fo=
r staffs.  Mine has three cleric cards.  Should end with 934atk staff

I pretty much heal as fast as I take damage in most cases.  And I like bein=
g able to heal while moving / fighting.  I don't care much for resurrection=
.  I mean if it managed to kill me, my pet/golem/NPC doesn't stand much cha=
nce anyway.=20

I've played around with a few other ideas, but I can't seem to get my overa=
ll stats any higher.  Don't suppose anybody has found a combo that will let=
 me use a spear and still get higher numbers?=20=20=20

Better late than never...

The 99 in all stats diet is a bad choice for any kind of pet since they can=
 be more of a hinderance than helpful.

For a chocobo fighting with you you'd ideally want one that's aggressive an=
d has got high power and high defenses.  This is a good recipe:

8 cycles of:
    1 =D7 Citrisquid, Citrisquid, Citrisquid
90 cycles of:
    1 =D7 Cabbadillo, Cabbadillo, Dialaurel

Level 99:
Power: 99.0, Skill: 99.0, Defense: 99.0, Magic: 99.0, HP: 99.0, Spirit: 99.=
0, Charm: 12.0, Luck: 5.0
Strike: 94.0, Slash: 94.0, Thrust: 94.0, Magic: 4.0, Total defense: 286
Offense: 59, Lucre: 10,100

The Dialaurel will increase the aggression, so you'll have a pretty powerfu=
l chocobo that will jump right in and attack.

Personally I'd ignore that diet.  What it's resulting in is a polterbox whi=
ch has 99 in almost all stats, and it's a very expensive diet.  You don't n=
eed high luck since luck and the polterbox's rare drop increase bonus don't=
 stack.  Since you want to rely on the polterbox's own rare drop increase b=
onus you don't want to make it aggressive or doing high amounts of damage b=
ecause the rare drop increase chance only kicks in when you do the killing =
blow.  Ideally you'd want it to stick like glue to you and do very little o=
f anything else.

Someone came up with this pretty decent recipe:

24 cycles of:
    1 =D7 Cabbadillo, Bug Meat, Squalphin
74 cycles of:
    1 =D7 Cabbadillo, Bug Meat, Bug Meat

Level 99:
Power: 10.0, Skill: 99.0, Defense: 99.0, Magic: 99.0, HP: 99.0, Spirit: 99.=
0, Charm: 3.0, Luck: 29.0
Strike: 50.0, Slash: 99.0, Thrust: 99.0, Magic: 77.0, Total defense: 325
Offense: 59, Lucre: 1,980

This results in a polterbox doing low damage and having no additional trait=
s for attacking.  Since cabbadillos increase both friendly and lonely trait=
s it might end up wandering around but it should stick close to you.  This =
is something I'd have to test myself.

An alternate diet to the previous one is this one:

22 cycles of:
    1 =D7 Cabbadillo, Cabbadillo, Squalphin
1 cycles of:
    1 =D7 Cabbadillo, Squalphin, Gold Clover
75 cycles of:
    1 =D7 Cabbadillo, Bug Meat, Bug Meat

Level 99:
Power: 21.0, Skill: 99.0, Defense: 99.0, Magic: 99.0, HP: 99.0, Spirit: 99.=
0, Charm: 3.0, Luck: 30.0
Strike: 61.0, Slash: 99.0, Thrust: 99.0, Magic: 78.0, Total defense: 337
Offense: 59, Lucre: 1,980

Gives a little more defense and slightly more power, however the additional=
 gold clover will increase friendliness slightly so it should stick around =
more often.
